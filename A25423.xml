         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

When this word is referred to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or to the affections of the ſoul, or the graces thereof, it doth, by ſimilitude taken from the body, ſignifie the ſtretching out of them, the meaſure of them, the earneſtnes and ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of them, and ſo is tranſlated either, inſtantly, as in this place, or

               <p>Some interpret this word in this place, perpetually, but you ſee it is tranſlated here, inſtantly, and in other places of Scripture, when it is applyed to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: and they that tranſlate it, perpetually, do imply this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40764:13"/> of affection, for whence comes perpetuity, length and continuance in any action, but from length of inward affection, the ſtretching out of that: as the length of the motion of a ſtone throwne with the hand, depends upon the ſtrength of the hand throwing the ſame. I take it, hereby is meant that gracious affection of zeal ſo much called for, and commended in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is not a mixt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of love, and anger but the intention and meaſure of all the affections, for there is zeal in griefe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.139. <hi>My zeal hath conſumed me: becauſe mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies have forgotten thy words.</hi> The terme being thus explained, the truth to be handled is.</p>
               <p>Gods worſhip is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with intention of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not onely the truth, but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40764:14"/> the ſtrength of affection is to be looked after and laboured for in Gods ſervice. The twelve tribes are here ſaid to ſerve the Lord <hi>inſtantly</hi> or earneſtly.</p>
               <p>I will ſhew more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what is meant by, <hi>inſtantly,</hi> and then produce proof.</p>
               <p>By <hi>inſtantly,</hi> is meant the meaſure and degree of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we expreſſe in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whether love, or deſire, or feare, or greife, or ioy, or anger, or care, that there be much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So what graces we expreſſe, faith, or repentance, or humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we take care that there be meaſure as well as truth, called <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.27. all the minde, and all the ſoule, all the heart, all, hath ſpeciall reſpect unto the meaſure and degree of the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoule; as all the might of the body doth meane all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40764:14"/> and meaſures of ſtrength, the utmoſt ſtrength, ſo in like manner, all the minde, all the heart, all the ſoul, means all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meaſures of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, will and affections the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and furtheſt of them, elſe our Saviours <hi>compendium</hi> of the firſt table ſhould not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I will for cleerer evidence ſake, ſhew it by inſtances in the ſeverall parts of Gods worſhip. 1. Hearing the word, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.20.21. when our Saviour had read his text, the eyes of all were faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon him, aſigne of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to heare him, they they did not looke about them one at another, or at them that came in, but their eyes were faſtned upon him, and they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the gracious words that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40764:15"/> proceeded out of his mouth, a ſigne they were much affected and moved, and did not ſit as ſtones ſenſeleſſe. The men of <hi>Berea, Act.</hi> 17.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>did receive the word with all readines of minde,</hi> they did in the greateſt meaſure put forth their hearts unto the words of the Apoſtle, to meet with it in the way, and to take it up ſo ſoone as it was let fall by him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.32. <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us when he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us the Scripture?</hi> burne theſe did and were in a flame, with indignation againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their ignorance, with deſire of, and joy in, the good and glad tydings of Chriſts death and reſurrection. 2. Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacraments the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.18. <hi>There was no Paſseover like to that kept in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael ſince the dayes of Samuel the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40764:15"/> Prophet.</hi> They exceeded in this Paſſeover, all the Paſſeovers of a long time, a ſigne they kept it with a great meaſure of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for would God onely have commended the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.15. <hi>With deſire I have deſired to eate this Paſſeover with you before I ſuffer,</hi> .i. with earneſt and vehement deſire, earneſt deſire to the ordinance doth imply earneſt deſire in the ordinances. The duty of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation required of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. doth carry as much; examination is the bellows of affection. The like we finde in the Eunuch in regard of baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.36. <hi>See, here is water, what doth hinder me to be baptized?</hi> He had a forward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the Evangeliſt ſhould have ſtirred up and provoked him, but he prevents him, is more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40764:16"/> forward to receive it then he to offer it. 3. Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.145. <hi>I cryed with my whole heart,</hi> he imploied all the affections of his heart in prayer, and that with earneſtnes, he cries, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.2. <hi>I poured out my complaint before him, David</hi> empties his ſoule in prayer, leaves nothing behinde, a ſigne of earneſtnes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.6. <hi>I ſtretch forth my hands unto thee,</hi> the inſtancy here ſpoken of, he fears leſt his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould fall ſhort of God, therefore ſends them forth with as great earneſtnes as may be. 4. Singing of pſalms, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 149.5, 6. <hi>Let them ſing aloud, let the high prayſes of God be in their mouthes,</hi> in ſinging pſalmes our hearts muſt be extended and ſtretched out, as the extending of the voice implies, our hearts muſt be wide open and filled with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40764:16"/> gracious affections. When God would expreſſe great Joy, he bids the mountains breake forth into ſinging, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 49.13. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18.19. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſse, but be filled with the ſpirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. we ſhould labour to drinke deepe of the ſpirit, and expreſſe it in ſinging and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melody in our hearts to the Lord, there muſt be a ſweet and loud ſounding joy in our hearts when we ſing pſalmes.</p>
               <p>For proofe of this truth may be brought in, the teſtimony of Scripture, examples commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reproofs of the contrary.</p>
               <p>The Scripture calls for this affection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord:</hi> if we ſhould be cold in our owne oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, which we are not, yet when we come to ſerve God
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40764:17"/> our ſpirits ſhould burne within us, with deſire and delight, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good to be Zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected allwayes in a good thing,</hi> good, becauſe agreeable to Gods will, to Gods nature, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the good we are zealous about, zealous affection in good, is allwaies good, other good things have their proper ſeaſon, this is allwaies in ſeaſon in every good action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſervants of God have thus practiſed, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was zealous for the ſervice and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, ſo that he had his conſcience on his ſide to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden him, to deſire mercy of God according to his forward affection that way, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Remember me, O my God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the houſe of my God, and the offices
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40764:17"/> thereof. David, Pſal.</hi> 69.9. <hi>The Zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up.</hi> Such was his affection to Gods Worſhip and Service, that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of deſire thereafter, and partly out of greife for the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, contempt and reproach thereof, he was even a devoured conſumed man, ſo great was his affection that way, that he ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed careleſſe every other way. And herein he was a type of the beſt of paterns, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who being a Preiſt, though not after the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> did expreſſe an ardent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in purging the Temple from the corruption of thoſe times, in ſo much that his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples thought he was an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent accompliſher of that place of propheticall Scripture, <hi>The Zeal of thy houſe hath eaten me up. John.</hi> 2.17. Who but a man in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40764:18"/> the power, and poſſeſſion of zeale to Gods houſe would have made a whip, and therewith dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out the polluters of the Temple, and have overthrown their Tables and Seats, and that with Scripture-chiding, <hi>Math.</hi> 21.13. Another remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance concerning our Saviour we have, <hi>John.</hi> 4.32.33.34. Whilſt his Diſciples were gone into the City to buy meat, he falls into parly with a woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> about her ſoul; when his Diſciples come again, they pray him to eat; he tells them he is provided, he had meat to eat they knew not of; his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſay one to another, <hi>Hath any man brought him meat to eat?</hi> our Saviour anſwereth, <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work.</hi> No meat could be more ſweet unto him,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40764:18"/> or refreſhing, then the doing of Gods will, a ſigne he was dearly affected thereto, that he could make food of it. The like we read of <hi>Apollos,</hi> Acts 18.25. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fervent in Spirit he ſpake and taught diligently the things of the Lord; he did not only preach the things of the Lord, but with fervencie of ſpirit, with a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart. Thus unleſſe we will be irregular in our ſerving of God, and unlike the approved Saints and ſervants of God in Scripture, yea, unlike Chriſt our patern, who was ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſet us a copy, we muſt perform Gods ſervice with earneſtneſſe of affection.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath reproved the want of this fervency of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his ſervice, a ſigne it is a tranſgreſſion. Where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40764:19"/> be Zealous alwaies in a good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> he doth conveigh a ſecret reproof of them who were dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected to the falſe Apoſtles, who were but counterfeit Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, but were aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their love to him a true Apoſtle, and ſo a true Ordinance of God, If it be good to be zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in a good thing, then it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil nor to be zealous. The luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm temper of <hi>Laodicca,</hi> the Lord reckons to be worſe then key cold. <hi>I would thou wert hot or cold,</hi> down-right, and ſenſibly good or evil; no temper ſo evil as lukewarm, he threatens to ſpue them out of his mouth; ſhewing, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus where God findes this fervency of ſpirit wanting, he ſpeaks ill of it; a figne his ſervice cannot well be performed without it, for he cannot be pleaſed with it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this fervency.</p>
               <p>For further proof.</p>
               <p>I will make uſe of the Lords own reaſons laid down, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment third, to which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this duty doth belong, and ſo I ſhall open that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſo far as concerns my purpoſe. What better, more weighty, more perſwading ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40764:20"/> then Gods own; God is all truth, and all underſtanding, he knows us better then we know our ſelves, and he is all wiſdom, that knows what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will beſt take with us upon ſeverall occaſions. The firſt Commandment taketh care that we make choiſe of the true God, and no other; the ſecond, that we embrace his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worſhip, and reject all others; the third, that we uſe his Name, all that whereby God is made known to us, reverently and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively as becometh the ſame. The Commandment is this, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that taketh his Name in vain;</hi> every word of the command is as well a reaſon as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The thing forbidden, is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40764:20"/> the taking of Gods name in vain. Before I ſpeak of the grounds of this prohibition, I muſt ſhow how this truth (of performing Gods worſhip with earneſtneſſe of affection) is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in this Commandment, and the contrary ſin forbidden; that will appear if we conſider two things: 1. Part of the meaning of Gods name is the worſhip of God, Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. That the name of God and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be not evil ſpoken of, where the name of God and his doctrine are all one. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.6. the name of God is put for his worſhip. 2. Part of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of taking Gods name in vain, is this want of fervent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Gods worſhip: are not light and empty things, vain things? and is not dead cold
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40764:21"/> ſervice of God, light ſervice and empty ſervice, that wants that weight and ſubſtance it ſhould have? Are not unuſefull and unprofitable things vain things? and is not careleſſe ſervice of God, unuſef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Would an earthly Governour accept you care not what? much leſſe will I. In like manner, if men hear the Word, receive the Sacrament, pray they care not how, ſo the duties be done, can God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40764:21"/> herewith? and if he be not pleaſed he is not honoured, for were he honoured he would be pleaſed, and if God be not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, the doers cannot bepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, for our good is wrapt up in Gods glory, and that ſervice which doth neither honour God nor profit the performers is vain ſervice.</p>
               <p>Having thus made it clear, that ardent ſervice of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and careleſſe ſerving of God prohibited in this third Commandment; Let us now conſider the reaſons why we muſt not reſt in careleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of worſhip, but on the contrary, muſt earneſtly worſhip him; they are 5. in number.</p>

Gods worſhip is his Name; that whereby God is made knowne to us, that whereby he is diſtinguiſhed from others, and whereby he is made glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: to be careleſſe of Gods worſhip, is to obſcure the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, to confound him with Idols, to hinder his glory, to be careleſſe whether God be known to us or others, be diſtinguiſhed from others, be famous and glorious: and to be earneſt in the worſhip of God, is to make the Lord better known to us and others, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference him from other Gods, and to make him glorious. And ſhall not our beſt affections be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40764:22"/> buſied about Gods worſhip, which is his Name? God hath betruſted us with his Name, that it lies in our power in ordinary courſe and for a time, to make him leſſe or more known, leſſe or more glorious; and ſhall we betray this truſt? Mans name is precious, and the name of one man committed to the keeping of another, to bear falſe witneſſe is a ſinne, much more is Gods name precious, which is the chief Governour, and much more committed to our truſt, and bearing falſe witneſſe to that is much more a ſinne, which we ſhall do, if we be careleſſe of his worſhip. Is not the knowledge of God the ground of our faith, hope, comfort? If God be not good, wiſe, powerfull, true, what ground have we to beleeve or hope for any good in this or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40764:23"/> another world? and if we know not the goodneſſe, wiſdom and power of God, what ground of comfort can we have? To ſleight Gods worſhip, is to ſleight the knowledge of God, and ſo the ground of our faith, and hope, and comfort therein: and to take care of Gods worſhip, is to take care of the knowledge of God, and ſo the ground of our faith, hope and comfort. Is not care of Gods glory the way unto, and evidence of our glory? To be earneſt in Gods worſhip, is to take care of Gods glory, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the way unto, and evidence of our glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods worſhip is the name of the Lord, the name of Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, therefore carefully and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently to be performed. His name it is who is the fountain of being, therefore the firſt being,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40764:23"/> and ſo of due the firſt and beſt ſervice belongs to him, becauſe none is before him, therefore none is to be ſerved before him; our Saviour when he duely ranketh and ordereth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart, this is the firſt and great Commandment, and the ſecond, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf;</hi> Why is the love of God, and ſo the ſervice of God, the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, before and greater then the love of our ſelves? but becauſe he is the firſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt before our ſelves, and greater then our ſelves; It had been ſin in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> to wiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of Heaven for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in hell, had not this been true, that God is before us, and ſo above us, of due to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us, though by our utter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40764:24"/> diſhonour? None ſhould go to hell, were not this true, that there is an honour due to God from the creature, above the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the creature; and could men be willing to go to hell that God might have glory, hell ſhould be no hell unto them; that which makes the torment of hell, is this, that God takes his glory, becauſe men will not give it him. All the godly, though they do not think ſo, do ſeek Gods glory above their own ſalvation, as they ſhould do, for they deſire their ſalvation as a way unto Gods glory; now the way that ſerves unto the end is leſſe deſired, then the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſerves. The worſhip we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme is the worſhip of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the fountaine of being, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the author of our being, from him we have all, unto him
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40764:24"/> therefore we muſt give all; all is his, we have nothing of our owne, our moſt lively affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are his owne, he is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to us for them, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without injuſtice and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery with-hold them; will we with-hold that which is Gods? will we diſpoſe of that which is Gods? Not only doth <hi>David</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the outward wealth, liberally given to the Temple, to be Gods own, but the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and joy of their hearts, whereby and wherewith they gave ſo liberally, to come from God, alſo 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. in that he prayes God to keepe this frame in them, and to prepare their hearts towards him: he that muſt keepe that willing and chearfull frame of heart in him, hath ſurely made the ſame, and he that

               <p>The worſhip we performe is the worſhip of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> his name who hath promiſed this fervency unto his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> .i. in the day of the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel, theſe ſhall with earneſt affection attend upon Gods ordinances, God having promiſed fervent affections in his ſervice, by labouring after the ſame, and expreſſing the ſame, we ſhall confirme and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the truth of God, and on the contrary, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>John.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth not maketh God a liar,,</hi> ſo he that doth not fervently worſhip God, doth what lies in him to falſifie the word of God, to

               <p n="3">3. Gods worſhip is the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lord thy God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be performed with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtnes. His name it is, who is not onely the Lord, but our God, a God in Covenant with us, he hath promiſed to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours, all that he is, or can do, ſhall be for us, and we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be wholly his, to be all that we are, or can do for him. If we beſtow the utmoſt of our affection upon him in his ſervice, we do no more then he hath done for us: and what can we give to him, if we give all we have, in compariſon of what he gives to us? Not only doth he give to us that ſtrength of affection, in compariſon of which all ours is nothing, but he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to us, he gives firſt, he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40764:26"/> gives not only more then we can give, but before us, we may well follow him with leſſe: what though others ſerve God they know not how? they have leſſe reaſon to ſhew ſtrength of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to God then we; though they have reaſon enough, for God hath not beſtowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly upon them as upon us. Beſide, being our God, the ſervice that is done to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds upon us, be it well or ill done, becauſe the Covenant doth not only imply relation, but union, it is a marriage-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, God becomes ours, and we become his. A man loves his wife, not becauſe ſhee is a friend, and loves him, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhee is himſelf, they are no more twain, but one, in loving her he loveth himſelf, and ſo much as he doth not love her,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40764:26"/> (though ſhee do not deſerve) he doth not love himſelf, for ſhee is one with himſelfe. A man doth not love himſelf, becauſe of deſert, but becauſe he is near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to himſelf, he is his own: ſo a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So God is our own, he is by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt, one with us, and we with him; did not God therefore deſerve our beſt affections (which he infinitly doth) yet we were bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the ſame upon him in his ſervice, becauſe he is our own, we have made him as our own ſoules, by entering into a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-Covenant with him; ſo much as we fall ſhort in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him, we fall ſhort in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Furthermore having promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the beſt of our affections un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

To be careleſſe in obſcure, darke, hidden good, is a ſmall matter; but to be careleſſe about emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent good, as Gods worſhip,

               <p>This argument common ſenſe will yeild to. That a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Maſter are to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, they cannot deny, they themſelves daily expect it, and receive it, in that relation.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40764:55"/> Gods holy things, and ſo ſinne. The preſence of betters might command more reſpect, much more of Saints and Angels, and moſt of all the preſence of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Standing up to gaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. We read that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtood up when <hi>Ezra</hi> opened the book of the law in the ſight of them all, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 8.5. and when our Saviour had read his text, <hi>the eyes of the people were faſtned on him, Luk.</hi> 4.20. but to ſtand up to gaze about us, to ſee whom of our freinds we can eſpy, or who comes in, or what apparell others weare, and that in time of ſinging of Pſalmes, or reading the word, or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word, doth ſhew a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme of Gods Ordinances. Can we finde ſomething more to be attended to then Gods
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40764:55"/> worſhip? a ſigne we thinke but meanly of that.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sleeping in time of Gods worſhip, a thing which our neighbours equall to us, would count a ſleighting of them, much more may God. Suppoſe a man ſhould be ſpeaking to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or ſpeaking ſome good of him in his preſence, or heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to his ſpeech, and he ſhould fall aſleep, would he not look at it as a ſleighty carriage? how much more if a man ſhould thus behave himſelf before his betters, and eſpecially before his Prince, and cheif govenr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? ſo is the caſe in publike worſhip, either we are ſpeaking unto God, as in prayer, or ſpeaking of God, as in reading the word, and ſinging of Pſalmes, or hearing God ſpeak to us, as in the preaching of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40764:56"/> word: if we ſleepe in all, or any of theſe, do we not ſhew that we lightly eſteeme them? that we do but little reſpect what we ſay unto God, or of God, or what he ſaith unto us? which how great a ſinne it is I leave to you to judge. Not but that ſome by reaſon of age, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of body, or want ſometimes of convenient reſt, or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of body, may be ſubject to heavines, who yet doe highly eſteeme Gods worſhip: but where there is a giving way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this, and it is not borne as a burden, which for the preſent a man would ſhake off, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is humbled for, it ſhewes a great diſeſteeme and diſreſpect of Gods worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To humble Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in regard of the guiltines of this ſinne, meane and low
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40764:56"/> thoughts of Gods worſhip. In this ſenſe we need <hi>Peters</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. <hi>to gird up the loynes of our mindes,</hi> our thoughts of Gods worſhip hang too looſe, and low, and had need be girt up cloſer, and higher. We ſhould call the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, the honourable of the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.13. Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O city of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 87.3. of the Church and Ordinances. <hi>We ſhould looke to our foote when we goe into the houſe of God, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. but our late comming, our heavines, our whiſperings, do ſhew that our thoughts are too low; for were our thoughts higher, our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages would be more reverent. This is our ſinne, and ſhould be our ſhame. And to humble us the more, conſider, either there is much ignorance in us of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40764:57"/> worth of Gods worſhip, or much careleſſenes of that worth we know, or much corruption, and but little grace, much of the old man, and but little of the new.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To fortifie them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Gods worſhip, againſt the ſpeeches and carriages of them that diſreſpect them. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have a good eſteeme of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prayer, of private and Church ordinances; but when they ſee and hear others ſleight the ſame, they pray not, they read not, they come not to the aſſembly, but they ſpeake ill of others that uſe them; hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they draw in, and are afraid to ſhew their reſpect. But let ſuch conſider what they doe. They that think meanly of good duties, doe ſinne, and wilt thou be beaten from thy duty by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40764:57"/> the ſinne of others? becauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe ill, wilt thou doe ill alſo? The ſinnes of others ſhould warne us from ſinne, not draw or drive us unto ſinne: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others deſpiſe Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, wilt thou deſpiſe them alſo? there is moſt need now to honour them, to recover that eſteeme which they loſe by others, for that is one reaſon why Gods people are called his portion, becauſe he makes up, by meanes of them, the loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of glory, that he ſuſtaines from the world, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.21. <hi>This people have I formed for my ſelf, they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe:</hi> though other people are for themſelves and their owne praiſe, yet his people ſhall be for his ends, and his praiſe: though prayer was cryed down in <hi>Babylon</hi> for thirty dayes, to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40764:58"/> make a ſnare for <hi>Daniel,</hi> yet the diſreſpective law againſt it could not make <hi>Daniel</hi> neglect his courſe of praying. Though <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was mocked by his own wife for dancing before the Arke, he anſwered, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and if that were to be vile, he would be more vile; ſo ſay thou, if to read and pray be to be vile, thou wilt make thy ſelfe more vile.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To provoke us to take heed of deſpiſing Gods holy things. Two arguments are at hand to diſſwade us. 1. It is ſinne, a ſinne that is obvious to every eye, an unnaturall ſinne. Will not all judge it a ſinne for a childe to deſpiſe his father, or a ſervant to deſpiſe his Maſter? Is it not an unnaturall ſinne? Nature bindes them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Is not God our Father,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40764:58"/> our Maſter, the beſt Father, the beſt Maſter, like whom is none, and is it not much more a ſinne, an unnaturall ſinne, a ſinne cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down by all to deſpiſe God? yet ſo we doe when we deſpiſe his worſhip, which is his name. What is worſe then ſinne? who would not avoid ſinne, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifeſt, and unnaturall ſinne, ſuch is this deſpiſing of Gods worſhip, for we returne diſreſpect for reſpect. The Pſalmiſt admires at Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.4. <hi>What is man?</hi> Though there be no worth in man, yet God ſhewes that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to man, that men are wont to doe to them that have great place, and worth; to diſreſpect him therefore is great ſinne. 2. Deſpiſing of Gods worſhip will hinder our earneſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God, doth not God
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40764:59"/> deſerve our beſt affections in his worſhip: and doe we not deſire to beſtow our beſt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon God in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? God will returne them to us better againe. This we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe if we deſpiſe Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Will we beſtow much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon that which we thinke is not worthy much? Let me adde one more argument to diſſwade us from deſpiſing Gods worſhip, drawn from the ill conſequence hereof, and this argument hath three ſeverall branches, I pray take notice of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our deſpiſing of Gods worſhip will redound to our diſhonour: if we expoſe them to ſleighting, by our ſleightly uſe of them, God will cauſe us to be deſpiſed. To deſpiſe Gods worſhip is to ſinne againſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40764:59"/> Gods honour, therefore Gods puniſhment ſhall be directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our honour, <hi>Mal</hi> 2.9. <hi>Therefore have I alſo made you baſe and contemptible before all the people.</hi> God made the prieſts generally and of all hands baſe and contemptible, and he did it alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> in relation and with reſpect unto that reproach and diſhonour they had put upon him, as it followeth in the verſe, According as ye have not kept my wayes, but have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall in the law: they diſhonour God by obeying but where they liſted, and God poured contempt upon them. Ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, miniſters that have but low thoughts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and meane behaviour in the ſame, God makes them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. Not only is it ſo with miniſters, who being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40764:60"/> perſons, do put more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour upon God, but alſo with private perſons, whoſe diſhonour of God is leſſe. <hi>Eſau</hi> deſpiſed his birthright, and therein the Covenant of God, and God caſt ſuch diſhonour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as can never be wiped away. An inſtance whereof is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. when the ſpirit of God had occaſion to ſpeak of him, and that act, he calls him by way of reproach, <hi>prophane Eſau,</hi> and that thouſands of yeares after the action, when one would have thought it had been forgotten, but God doth not ſo eaſily forget diſhonour done to him. <hi>Michal</hi> ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth <hi>David</hi> worſhipping of God, and what was her puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.? Not only that which was an affliction, but that which was over and beſides a ſpeciall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40764:60"/> reproach, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.23. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had no childe to the day of her death.</hi> A woman whoſe name ſhould be buried with her ſelf, but her reproach ſhould live, ſhe had no childe, becauſe ſhe deſpiſed <hi>David</hi> worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God. If therefore we have any reſpect to our honour, as we have, if we be not deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſpirit of men and women: for what is a mans life without reſpect, but a living in the grave, a being buried whilſt a man lives? let us take heed of deſpiſing Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our deſpiſing of Gods Ordinances doth not reſt, or is limited in them, but paſſeth through them unto God, doth not ſtay till it commeth unto him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. <hi>He that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth you heareth me, and he that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40764:61"/> deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me deſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> The Apoſtles were but ignorant and unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, fiſhermen, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered, but when they became veſſels to carry the word of God unto the world, then what reſpect was ſhewed to them, was done to God, and what diſreſpect was done to them, did not reſt till it came to the higheſt Majeſty: for they are the Ordinances of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and of his glory. His Name is called upon them, his commiſſion is with them, nay his preſence is with them, <hi>Math.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Where two or three are met in my Name, I am in the midſt of them.</hi> A notable proof hereof we finde in <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.23, 24. when little children mocked him, <hi>he cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40764:61"/> them in the Name of the Lord, i. e.</hi> in the Lords au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, command and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Had not their mocking of <hi>Eliſha</hi> been Gods cauſe, he had ſinfully uſed Gods Name and authority. If a Maſter ſend his ſervant about ſome errand, and give him power to uſe his Name in it, may he alſo uſe his Name about his own buſines? Nor had his curſe been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for he could not have ſent the bears to have deſtroyed them, which is one of Gods ſore judgements, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.21. and God would not have ſent them had not the cauſe been his own. Let us now conſider. Men that deſpiſe the word and prayer, yet do not thinke God is to be deſpiſed, but rather thinke him not worthy to live that doth deſpiſe God, for God is of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40764:62"/> worth and goodnes, yet in deſpiſing theſe they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe God, for it is prayer unto God, and reading Gods word, the meanes are his meanes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his authority, and for his glory, you cannot ſeparate God and them: when men ſpeake ill of profeſſours for praying, reading, they thinke they ſpeake ill of men, and that not for goodnes, but nicenes and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictnes: but they ſpeake ill of God in men, they ſpeake ill of godly men, who do read and pray, not becauſe it is their own minde, but Gods minde: and ſhall we run into ſuch horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profannes to ſpeake ill of God?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Deſpiſing of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is the way to quench the ſpirit in our hearts, and in the ordinances. Theſe two are put
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40764:62"/> together, as depending one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.19, 20. <hi>Quench not the ſpirit: Deſpiſe not propheſying,</hi> implying, that to deſpiſe propheſying, is the way to quench the ſpirit.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40764:63"/> which ſhould nouriſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its ſlame. If a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Gods ordinances, either he will not make uſe of them at all, or never the better, and then the nouriſhment of the fire of the ſpirit is taken away, and ſo it is quenched. As therefore we would have the ſpirit ſlame in our hearts, and in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, let us take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the ordinances. Do we not finde a damp of Gods ſpirit in our hearts, and in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the cauſe is here, we have taken away the fewel, by ſleighting the ordinances.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40764:65"/> that which conveys moſt honour to God is moſt honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo do the ordinances of God, therefore they are moſt honourable.

In Gods providence we have many ſweet mercies which we could not want, as health, eſtate, friends, guidance, protection, but in the ordinances we finde God, and Chriſt, and eternall life, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.34.35. They that wait at the gates of wiſdome, and attend at the poſts of her doores, are bleſſed, for they finde Chriſt, and with him life and ſavour at Gods hands.

               <p>N. The abſence of our thoughts in Gods worſhip doth weaken our worſhiping of God. Wandring thoughts in Gods worſhip, do hinder our earneſt worſhipping of God.

                  </gap>nce ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly as here he threatneth to do? <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.7. our Saviour calleth them that worſhip God with their bodies, and their heart
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:40764:70"/> farre from him, hypocrites: ſuch worſhip therefore hath hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy in it, and the more wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of minde, the more hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and if ſo, it is but weak worſhip. The Lord by the Prophet doth particularly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the hearing of the wicked, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. that ſo farre as concerned the outward man, they did hear as well as a people could, they came duly, and ſate reſpectively: and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were ſomewhat affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Word, as men are with pleaſant muſick, but their hearts walked after their covetouſnes, their bodies were in one place, but their thoughts and affections in another; their bodies were ſixed, but their ſouls were roving, and this made their hearing to become ſinne, and God to threaten, that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40764:70"/> the day ſhould come when they ſhould know, by lamentable experience, that they had a Prophet, and the Word amongſt them, and were hearers of it, but ſinned by the wandring of their hearts. When <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 103.1. calls upon his ſoul to be exerciſed in the duty of praiſe, he explaineth in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end of the verſe what he meaneth by, ſoul, <hi>all that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me praiſe his holy Name.</hi> If the duty of praiſe (and ſo other duties) have not all that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, and conſequently our thoughts, it hath not its due, and ſo Gods praiſe is ſhort. To this agrees that of our Saviour, ſumming up all Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt Table in this one, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy minde.</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:40764:71"/> One branch of this love of God is the manner of worſhipping God, which muſt be with all the minde, as well as all the heart and ſoul, and if with all the minde, then with all the thoughts of the minde, and ſo much as the thoughts are abſent in Gods worſhip, ſo much love to God is abſent, therefore the worſhip of God is hindred.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40764:72"/> Thoughts about evil things, and thoughts about good things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wandring thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things evil in themſelves, thoughts ſimply and materially evil, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.5, 6. Thus the <hi>Iews</hi> are brought in, <hi>Saying, When will the new moone be gone, and the ſabbath?</hi> why? <hi>that they may ſell corne, and ſet forth wheat.</hi> Is that all? No there is a worſe matter beſide, <hi>making the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phah ſmall, and the ſhekel great, and falſifying the balances by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit: That we may buy the poor for ſilver, and the needy for a paire of ſhoes, and ſell the refuſe of the wheat.</hi> It was not likely that they were ſo profane as to ſay ſo, but they ſaid ſo in their thoughts, which whiſpering the Lord heard, and ſo reports them, theſe were wandring
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40764:72"/> thoughts, evil in themſelves, thoughts of deceit, of falſhood, of oppreſſion, of injuſtice, and that in the Sabbaths. Thus wicked <hi>Jezebel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.8, 9, 10. calls upon the Elders of <hi>Ieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel</hi> to proclaime a faſt, and in it to buſie their thoughts about falſe witneſſe, and murther, two men muſt come in and witneſſe that <hi>Naboth</hi> blaſphemed God and the King, and then he muſt be carried out and ſtoned, theſe things their thoughts muſt be buſied about as the maine end of their faſting. Our Saviour chargeth the Phariſees that they did devoure widows houſes, and for a pretence, or cloke, to hide it, make long prayers, in their prayers their thoughts did buſie themſelves about hiding their oppreſſion and cruelty, the main end of their praying.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40764:73"/> Thoughts in themſelves evil, in time of Gods worſhip, are moſt evil. 1. Becauſe they argue deepe hypocriſie, for they are directly contrary to God, &amp; yet covered over with ſhew of love to God. To colour over great hatred of God with ſhow of love, is great hypocriſie. 2. Great injury is done to God, for in the very time that we ſhould do ſervice to him in a ſpeciall manner, we do ſpeciall ſervice to the devil. 3. Deepe diſhonour is put upon holy duties, as if they had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with ſinne, and could complie with it, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede deſtroy their nature, why elſe are theſe thoughts, evil in themſelves, admitted when ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties are in hand? 4. Our ſpirits are ſpecially poiſoned hereby, more then if we had them at another time, becauſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40764:73"/> a greater curſe goeth with them in that they abuſe a time of bleſſing. The devil is therefore the worſt creature, being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, becauſe he was the beſt creature in creation; and times of greateſt bleſſing perverted, are times of greateſt curſe. Let a man abuſe the ſabbath, time of prayer, time of hearing, with unclean, drunken, oppreſſing thoughts, he ſhall be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from God then if he had the ſame unclean, drunken, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing thoughts at another time, and in other occaſions, for the ſinne is aggravated from the time &amp; occaſion, and ſo the curſe increaſed, which well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of, would make us take heed how we ſpend the ſabbath, how we carry our ſelves in holy duties, leſt ſuffering ſin to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red we become deeply accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Wandring thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout earthly good things in Gods worſhip, are ſuch thoughts as are imployed about our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular callings, or proviſion for our ſelves and children, or about our pleaſures and recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, thoughts warrantable and lawfull, yea neceſſary at other times, but now wandring thoughts, becauſe the minde is in other imployment. God pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily ſaith, that on the ſabbath day we ſhall do no manner of work, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.10. If our hands reſt and our thoughts be working, is that no

God forbids us to finde our own pleaſure on his holy day: and do we not finde our pleaſure by our thoughts? Thoughts will frame the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enjoying of any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or recreation. If thoughts about earthly good things hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in time, ſet apart for God, are wandring, and ſo ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then in like manner ſuch thoughts had in duties ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part for God, are wandring, and therefore ſinfull.

               <p>Wandring thoughts in duty impertinent, and of divers kinde, are ſuch as theſe. When a man in time of hearing the Word, hath thoughts of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or of ſome Sermon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Spirituall thoughts pertinent, and of the ſame kinde with the worſhip in hand, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to be accounted wandring and ſinfull thoughts: As for example, a man is hearing the Word of God, and ſome thoughts come into his minde ſuitable to what is ſpoken, ſome place of Scripture to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or ſome place of Scripture inlightned to a man, beyond what light the Miniſter giveth to it, or ſomething come to minde a man hath heard before to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>A man alſo joins in praier with others, and beſides the thoughts of what is praied, he hath other like thoughts of his own; if theſe like thoughts do clear the duty in hand to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40764:76"/> do increaſe attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and affection to what is in doing, they are not wandring thoughts, but they are conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoughts, thoughts that keep up and keep cloſe the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and affection to Gods worſhip, and do prevent the weakning and waſting of the ſame, and they are the work of the enlarging and eſtabliſhing ſpirit, which can at the ſame time ſuggeſt new thoughts, and make them helpfull to us. But if theſe pertinent and like thoughts do carry away the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and take it wholly up, that what is in hand, is negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the thoughts lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e the preſent duty, and are long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can recall themſelves, and finde the duty, then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily they are the work of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and corruption, working as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40764:76"/> an Angel of light, doing evil, but in ſuch a way as may not be diſcovered, for who would ſuſpect good thoughts in duty of the very ſame kinde, to come from Satan and corruption? I ſay, if theſe like thoughts do carry away the attention, they are ordinarily evil, for God may, and ſometimes doth, (as experience proves) ſo take up the thoughts and affections with ſomething in the Word and praier, that is ſuitable to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ſoul, that it can minde nothing elſe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but as the ſoul hath dwelt upon ſome matter of ſorrow, and been deeply humbled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſo God will have a man dwell upon ſome matter of comfort, till the heart be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refreſhed thereby: but this is more then ordinary, we may
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40764:77"/> not neglect any part of worſhip, but God may imploy us about ſome part if he will, this act is not voluntary or deliberate, but the ſoul is carried thereto by the power of the ſpirit of God. Theſe wandring thoughts in Gods worſhip, imploied about things good in themſelves, earthly good, or ſpirituall good things, are therefore ſinfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wandring, and therefore:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Impertinent, and ſo a part of diſorder and confuſion, which God is not the authour of, they are out of their place and ranke, they ſhould not come in when other occaſions and duties take place, they have no due place now, they doe but uſurp.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Being wandring, they are unſeaſonable, out of their time, and therefore undecent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely, for time doth give
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40764:77"/> a beauty to things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Being wandring they are diſtracting, they goe from the duty in hand, take away part of the ſouls ſtrength, and thereby weaken the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and thus pertinent thoughts ſometimes gain the name of wandring thoughts, from the effect, becauſe they make the ſoul to wander.</p>
               <p>Having ſeen the nature and kindes of wandring thoughts in Gods worſhip; Let us now conſider how they do hinder our earneſt worſhipping of God.</p>

               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:40764:78"/>1. Wandring thoughts do weaken the inward power of the ſoul to worſhip God, and ſo hinder our fervent and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate worſhipping of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As they take up part of the minde, ſo that Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath not the whole minde, as it ſhould have. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy minde.</hi> A man doth not pray with all his minde, nor hear with all his minde, part is beſtowed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: let a river be parted into two ſtreams, and it cannot runne ſo full in both, as it would in one. No finite minde can be ſo ſtrong about many objects at ſame time, as about one. Wandring thoughts make God to be worſhipped with a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, parted minde, with a piece of the minde, therefore weakly.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:40764:78"/>2. Wandring thoughts in worſhip do not onely take up part of the minde, and ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the power of the ſoul to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, but they do take off the minde from the worſhip in hand, ſo God ſaith, <hi>the heart is removed farre from me, and their hearts goeth after their covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:</hi> that is, the minde is much nearer ſuch thoughts, and more taken up with them, then with the Word or praier, the minde is wholly with them, or at leaſt chiefly with them. As it is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſeen when doggs are follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hare, if a new one be ſtarted, they follow that, and leave the other: ſo when we are praying, reading, hearing, if new thoughts ariſe in our hearts, we let go our thoughts of the duty, and follow them, and ſo God hath ſcarce a part of our
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40764:79"/> minde in his worſhip, if any, it is the leaſt part.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wandring thoughts do weaken the power of the ſoul to worſhip God, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they take up part of the minde, and take off the minde from Gods worſhip, but alſo becauſe in ſo doing, they take up and take off the affections and endeavours, the deſires and delights of the ſoul, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the body. What a man doth not think of, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſire or delight in, and what he doth but little think of, he will but little deſire and delight in, and conſequently will take little pains about. Thus wandring thoughts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away the minde from Gods worſhip, do alſo carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the affections and outward man: and if God hath neither
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:40764:79"/> minde, nor affections, nor body, or but little of them, then he hath but weak ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wandring thoughts do hinder our thorow worſhipping of God, as they do weaken the power of the aſſiſting ſpirit in our hearts; and that they doe three waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As they draw us from preſent ſpirituall thoughts about the worſhip in hand, which are the work of Gods ſpirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with grace in the heart. We cannot think a good thought in a duty, without the aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, All our ſufficiency (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.) is of God, and he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the ſmalleſt power of the ſoul, thoughts; we cannot think any thing of our ſelves: when therefore wandring thoughts do take us from ſuch thoughts,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40764:80"/> as the aſſiſting ſpirit hath wrought in us, doth it not weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the power of the aſſiſting ſpirit?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wandring thoughts being evil, and ſinfull do grieve the ſpirit of God, and ſo weaken the aſſiſting power of the ſpirit: when a man is grieved he will have no minde to ſhew his love and power, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Grieve not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the holy ſpirit of God,</hi> unholines is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the nature of the ſpirit, therefore doth grieve it, and wandring thoughts in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are unholines, becauſe they ſeparate the ſoul from God, when the body comes near him, they are therefore contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and grievous to Gods ſpirit, and makes it unwilling to ſhew it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Wandring thoughts doe
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40764:80"/> weaken the power of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſpirit of God. Becauſe they hinder us in the way of the ſpirit, the Word, Praier, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein the ſpirit is wont to conveigh himſelf more unto us. Wandring thoughts do prevent our carefull uſe of the ordinances, and ſo a greater meaſure of the ſpirits aſſiſtance, which we ſhould have in thoſe Ordinances, were wandring thoughts abſent. If wandring thoughts do weaken the power of Gods aſſiſting ſpirit in our hearts, they muſt needs hinder our fervent worſhipping of God, for the exerciſe of the ſtrength of our ſouls depends upon the aſſiſtance of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>But it may be demanded fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what are the cauſes of theſe wandring thoughts? and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40764:81"/> how comes it to paſſe that the godly are troubled with them in good duties, that do ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the due worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a three-fold cauſe of them.
<list>
                     <item>1. Our ſelves.</item>
                     <item>2. Satan.</item>
                     <item>3. God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. We our ſelves are the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of wandring thoughts in Gods worſhip. How? Surely many waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As we have a remnant of originall corruption, a root and ſtock, yet living and fruit bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and one fruit is evil thoughts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. <hi>out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, i. e.</hi> the heart being an evil tree. It is the happines of a good tree to bring forth fruit in ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. good, and ſeaſonable good, and it is the curſe of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, a bad tree, to bring
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40764:81"/> forth fruit out of ſeaſon, good thoughts, but out of ſeaſon. More particularly, ſinne hath brought a vanity upon our mindes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. and there is yet a remnant of it in us, <hi>i. e.</hi> the more worth, and weight, and excellency is in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y thing, the leſſe we in our mindes ſuit with it, and the more light and empty any thing is, the more our mindes agree thereto: now thoughts on the by, have not that worth and excellency in holy duties, that pertinent thoughts inlarging our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Beſides, the more any thing requires the fixing, ſetling, and holding cloſe of the thoughts, as good duties do, the leſſe do our mindes ſuit therewith, our mindes are vain, &amp; inconſtancy, variety, change, and alteration of thoughts, do
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40764:82"/> beſt pleaſe them. Experience tells us, that it is painfull to keep our mindes cloſe to a duty, and to let them rove and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is an eaſe to us, a ſigne of their vanity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Want of inuring and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming our ſelves unto good thoughts in ordinary courſe, and to ſetlednes therein, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming our mindes to rove and wander, to take their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, and boundleſſe liberty, whereby their averſenes unto good thoughts is not weakned, but their forwardnes unto va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and wandring of thoughts ſtrengthened: cuſtome is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond nature, what we uſe our ſelves to, will be ready and eaſy to us. If we ordinarily diſuſe good thoughts, we do not raiſe up our mindes to heaven in our callings, upon ſight of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40764:82"/> we do not parley, and commune with our hearts, in ſome holy ſpirituall conference, when we lie down, and when we riſe up, when we ſit in our houſes, and when we walk by the way, we ſhall finde that when we come to holy duties, holy thoughts will be tedious and painfull, for we ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two natures: one that ſin hath brought, and another that cuſtom hath brought. And ſuppoſe we have a new nature, a little grace, yet what will a little grace do againſt two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? on the other ſide, if we uſe our ſelves to ſinfull thoughts, or to roving and wandring of minde; we ſhall come to an art and trade of ſinfull and vain thoughts, they will eaſily come into our mindes in holy duties, without any pains, any ſtudy or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40764:83"/> deviſing, there will be ſwarms and treaſures there, the minde by continuall uſe, will have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a more perfect faculty and ability in ſuch thoughts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An overfullneſſe of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſions, or a fullneſſe of thoughts, deſires and cares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a few occaſions hindring, or inſtead of dependence upon God. When a mans hands are ſo full of occaſions, that his minde hath hardly room e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the thoughts thereof, at leaſt in due time, or when all a mans thoughts, morning, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, all the day long, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up about that buſineſſe he hath in hand, that no ſpirituall thoughts can get place in the minde, they will not be ſhut out in good duties, thoſe thoughts that have all place at other times, will have ſome place in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40764:83"/> Gods worſhip. Beſide, too much to do with the world, or too much thought about the world, will make all the faculties of the ſoul more ready and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant that way. Some occaſion amongſt many will be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or an occaſion might have been diſpatched ſome other way, and the memory will not be wanting to ſuggeſt it, no not in midſt of good duties. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of occaſions or ſollicitude about them, have a power to pull the minde apeeces, to divide it into parts, that if the worſhip of God have any of the minde, it ſhall have but a part. When <hi>Martha</hi> was ſo ſollicitous about providing for our Saviours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, he chides her, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, Martha,</hi> thou careſt, and he uſeth a word that ſignifieth to cut into parts, her ſoul was all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40764:84"/> apeeces with it, and therefore unfit to hear till that care ſhould be gone, and her ſoul return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it ſelf. Immoderacie of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection will breed immoderacie of thoughts, if there be not a greater dependence. If a man be ſollicitous about good duties, how he ſhall perform them, how he ſhall pray, how he ſhall hear, and do not look up to God as able and willing to helpe him, thoſe thoughts will not reſt, nor lye ſtill, when the duty is in hand, for a man ſeeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to quiet his thoughts.</p>
               <p>In like manner, if a mans thoughts be taken up with his earthly occaſions, and he do not think, and that much, that God taketh care for him, if he doth not often call to minde the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, the providence of God, his preventing and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40764:84"/> providence, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences he hath had of the ſame, his carefull thoughts will not be quiet in holy duties, for only two things can give any quiet to the minde. 1. A mans own imployment about them. 2. Aſſurance and remembrance of Gods care. If a mans thoughts be full of his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he will forget Gods care, therefore his thoughts will be ranging in duties, for he hath nothing to quiet him, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment about them; his body cannot be imployed, for that is about good duties, he muſt let his minde therefore be caſting, and thinking about them in holy duties, or elſe he will have no quiet of minde.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Want of reverence: did we look upon Gods worſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively as a matter of that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40764:85"/> worth and weight that indeed it hath, we would take heed that our thoughts be weighty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Want of preparation: When we come with earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts, with wandring mindes, do not winde them up, nor ſet them in tune by ſome ſpirituall thoughts, by prayer, how ſhould they but worke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their naturall frames, when we do not ſtir up the ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our mindes? We muſt not thinke that we have good thoughts at command, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ready, unleſſe our mindes were perfectly regenerate: what we get now muſt be by the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. by ſtrugling and ſtriving.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Want of watchfullneſſe in duties. 1. We do not watch our mindes that they do not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40764:85"/> wander, but keep cloſe to the duty. 2. We do not watch our affections, that they be affected and moved with the duty: if they were affected, they would keep the thoughts cloſe. 3. We do not watch our eies, that they do not rove from one object to another, for then they will miniſter matter of wandring to the minde.</p>
               <p>And on the Lords day we do not watch our tongues, that they ſpeak not of the world, and our eares that they hear not others ſpeak of the world; for if our tongue may have liberty to ſpeak of the world, and our ears to hear matters of the world ſpoken of, (ſave in caſe of ſome ſpirituall ends or uſe made thereof) our mindes will be thinking of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Satan hath his hand in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40764:86"/> wandring thoughts. He comes to Church with us, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1. He ſtood at <hi>Ioſuas</hi> right hand to reſiſt him, he watcheth the beſt opportunity to hinder us. The high-way ſide ground hearers have the word taken from them by the Devil. How? they underſtand it not: when the Word is delivering, the Devil fills their mindes with other thoughts, that they do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Word, nor know what is ſpoken: ſome wandring thoughts he immediately caſts in without any help of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: he is a ſpirituall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, therefore can conveigh himſelf into our ſpirits, have communion and converſe with them. Such as come immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from Satan, diſcover themſelves thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By their ſuddainnes, they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40764:86"/> are with us ere we are aware, we cannot diſcern the riſe of them, other thoughts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our corruption hath an hand, do come more leaſurely and by degrees, upon occaſion of ſome object, or ſome thing remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, or ſome thing repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the minde, we ſee their riſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their ſinfulnes ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, for comming immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Satan, and being his children onely, they muſt needs more lively expreſſe his nature and image (ſave when he doth transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, as ſometimes he doth) and Satan is worſe, more ſinfull then our hearts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thoughts that come from him, will ordinarily be more ſinfull, like their p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">

               <p n="2">2. By the meaſure of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the gracious heart, it doth more forcibly repell them with greater ſtrength of deteſtation, for grace not being weakned by them, having no hand in them, doth more eaſily diſcern them, and is more able to deteſt them, whereas when the ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some wandring thoughts he caſts immediately, by means of the corruption of our hearts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By occaſion of ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to our eie or ear.</p>

               <p n="1">1. To chaſtiſe them for a double ſin. Firſt neglect of good motions: they that have ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ighted good thoughts, and the comfort of them, it is juſt they ſhould feel the ſorrow of evil thoughts. Secondly, too much favouring of wandring thoughts: what hath been the ſin, God often makes the rod of his; wandring thoughts have been their ſin, therefore ſhall be their rod.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:40764:88"/>2. To keep their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and humble: the ground of pride is ſome good thing, ſome worth, ſome excellency reall, or imagined: what greater good then communion with God in holy duties, the exerciſe of graces, the powring out of the ſpirit upon us? nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo fit to be matter of pride: but when the godly look into their hearts, and ſee ſuch wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts, they are kept from exalting themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Still to convince them thorowly, and to put them in minde what need they have of a Saviour: they ſee matter of damnation, deſert of hell in their beſt duties.

                  <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. Hence we may take notice. 1. Of the evil nature of ſin, it ſtands in direct oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the good God, to his ſervice and glory, for this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth manifeſt, that though ſin be never ſo ſecret,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40764:89"/> never ſo ſmall if but in thought, yet it doth weaken the worſhip of God, and therefore hinder his glory. Men may, to the eie of men, worſhip and honour God as much as any, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage of their bodies may be ſuch, but if ſin be but within the thought, it will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the ſoul from the body, carry away the beſt part of man from the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The exactnes and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the worſhip of God. It requires the whole man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part thereof, even to the leaſt thought of the minde. It will not abate a thought, it will not ſuffer one thought to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but will complain that its due is wanting, that it is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and wronged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The miſtake of the world, who being very looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,

No not poſſible. Nay they cannot poſſibly be ſo ſtrict, as they ſhould be, therefore it is leſſe poſſible that they ſhould be too ſtrict, too preciſe. The wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God requires that all our thoughts ſhould be kept cloſe unto it, that not one ſhould wander.

Hypocriſy, in that they make ſhew of what they do not, they make ſhew of true and earneſt worſhipping of God, by the preſence of their bodies, but they do nothing leſſe. Idolatry, in that they give leave to their ſouls, becauſe their operations are hidden and ſecret, to do that which they will not give leave to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to do in the eie of man. What is this but to make an Idol of God, as if he did not ſee the ſouls actions, as well as men ſee the actions of the body: and if he doth ſee them, why do men give more liberty to their thoughts, which are in Gods eie, then to their actionsi which are in mans eie?</p>
               <p n="2">2. To reprove. 1. An opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40764:91"/> planted by Satan in the mindes of men, contrary to this truth I have in hand; That thoughts are not to be mattered, thoughts are free, we need not be troubled at them: If thoughts be free, then they are not to be regarded in the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>But they are to be regarded in Gods worſhip, for they make it better or worſe; therefore they are not free.</p>
               <p>And do we think the law of God doth take hold of thoughts onely in Gods worſhip? No, it is not ſo partiall, it is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect then ſo. What ſhould make men thinke thoughts are not to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Surely ſuch grounds as will not hold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſecrecy of them, they are unknown, hidden, ſecret in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40764:92"/> the ſoul. To whom are thoughts unknown? to men. And is mans knowledge the only or chief rule of our care about our thoughts, that if he know them not, we need not regard them? Hath man given us a command? Or muſt man be our judge? Our thoughts are ſufficiently known to God, and our conſciences do know them, and if theſe could be ignorant, it were better, though all the world did know them; and though they be hid from men for a time, yet they ſhall know them at the day of judgement: if therefore the knowledge of men would make us regard them, we muſt regard them, for though they do not know them at preſent, yet they ſhall know them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The multitude of them,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40764:92"/> they are numberleſſe, who can count or tell them: Therefore they are not to be regarded? The more our thoughts are, the leſſe free they are, the more to be regarded, for were all our thoughts good, as in innocency they were, and in heaven they ſhall be, what a world of good were there? And if they be evil, the more they are the more evil.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The impoſſibility of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them: would a man put to all his care, the minde will not be kept in compaſſe: paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are unruly, but not ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly as thoughts: the moſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate man in the world doth not offend ſo much in paſſion, as in thoughts: If paſſions at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time break out, if we look back, we ſhall ſee many paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thoughts have gon before,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40764:93"/> thoſe paſſions that have broken out, have been acted over in our thoughts, our thoughts have been very angry, when our tongues have been ſilent. There is indeed an impoſſibility of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our thoughts alltogether, but was this planted in us by God? Then indeed it would be an excuſe, did not ſin bring it upon us? And ſhall we think to make that want an excuſe, which we have brought upon our ſelves? And becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perfectly governe our thoughts, ſhall we let looſe the raines unto them? becauſe we cannot do all we ſhould do, ſhall we do nothing at all? Not go to the furtheſt we can? That thoughts are to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will appear, if we conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are abominations in the thoughts, we think that

Thou haſt thought that the gifts of

               <p n="2">2. God as well knowes our thoughts as our actions: this is one of Gods peculiar abilities, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13. He declareth unto man what is his thought. An inſtance whereof we have in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In this reſpect <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. That God revealeth deep and ſecret

If our thoughts be ſecret and hidden, yet God ſearcheth all hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>The heart is deceitfull above all things, who can know it?</hi> I the Lord. How ſhould God know it, and it be dece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things? He doth ſearch the hearts and try the reins. By how much the heart is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull then other things, by ſo much the Lord doth more narrowly look into it, then into other things. This is made the reaſon, why the Word of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12, 13. becauſe all things are naked and opened before him,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40764:95"/> with whom we have to do: what though the heart have many coverings and garments to hide it from the eie of man? yet when God comes to look upon it, they are taken away, the heart is naked. What though there be many curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works in the heart, one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p n="2">2. God knows our thoughts a farre off, what we will think before we think it, his infinite eie will ſee all things at the ſame time, much more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40764:95"/> doth he know our thoughts, when we our ſelves know them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to our thoughts, ſo will conſcience, Gods vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, acquit and condemn us; our thoughts are evidence ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, whether we ſhall go to heaven or to hell therefore they are to be regarded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. their thoughts accuſing or excuſing one another. If ſome thoughts be evil, other thoughts will accuſe them, and if ſome thoughts be good, other thoughts will excuſe them, and as our conſciences in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned do accuſe or excuſe, ſo will God do, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.20, 2. If our hearts condemn us, God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things: our hearts know but ſomethings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for, but God knoweth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40764:96"/> all things amiſſe in us, but if our hearts condemn us not, then have we boldnes towards God. It is ſo farre from being a truth, that thoughts are not to be regarded, that if we ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider it, they are in the firſt place, and chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are the firſt ſtep and beginning of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance publike or private, for they are the very firſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the firſt and leading fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the ſoul, the minde. They that would have any thing furthered, muſt eſpecially have an eie to the beginning, for a little help in the beginning will help much, and a little hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the beginning will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much: if therefore we would have that which is good,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40764:96"/> go forward, and would have our communion with God in holy duties furthered, we muſt look to our thoughts, for they are the beginning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our thoughts are the riſe and well-ſpring of all evil. No evil is at any time in tongue or life, but was firſt in thought. Such breakings out in tongue, as men are aſhamed of, did firſt make a gap in the thoughts. Actuall ſins in Scripture are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inventions, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>God made man upright, but he hath found out many inventions:</hi> the firſt apoſtaſy and fall of our parents, was a finding out of many inventions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.8. He took vengeance of their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Actuall ſins, the ſins of the outward man, are therefore called inventions, becauſe f you follow any ſin to the fount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40764:97"/> and ſpring, you ſhall finde it was an invention, it began in a device, an imagination. Art thou aware that the furtheſt ſin goeth, the worſe, and would'ſt thou ſtop it in the beginning? then look to thy thoughts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, if any anger, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, come into thy tongue, they will be firſt in thy thoughts, and if thou wouldſt keep them out of thy tongue, thou muſt regard thy thoughts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Little doſt thou, or any man know, to what one thought may grow, be it good or evil: behold, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3.5. how much a little fire kindleth, a thought is but a ſpark, yet a ſpark of fire that will kindle wonderfull much, if not quenched there. To ſee the ſtream and ſpring of ſome river, a man would hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40764:97"/> that ſo great a ſtream came from ſo ſmall a fountain. The greateſt good and evil that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in the world, was at firſt but a little thought. Thoughts therefore are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, yea chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. If a good thought come into thy heart, and thou cheriſh it, and the ſpirit of God move upon it, thou canſt not tell what may proceed from it. If an evil motion come into thy heart, and thou let it go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controll, and the Devil be ſuffered to hatch it, it will grow to a monſter of ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thou maieſt ſin in thought, and not ſin in word or deed, but thou canſt not ſin in word or deed, but thou muſt firſt ſin in thought. Sin in thought is more eaſily and ſuddainly committed, and more indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40764:98"/> then in word or deed, therefore thoughts are chiefly to be looked unto. Many will bleſſe themſelves from ſuch and ſuch ſins in life, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers runne into, and they look carefully to their ſteps, not conſidering they may commit the ſame ſin in their thoughts, (which they give liberty unto) though not in life, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould look firſt to their thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Generall and common careleſnes of thoughts in Gods worſhip is to be reproved. Is it not a fault for men to be careles how they worſhip God? who is ſo great and ſo good, ſo great that none is like him, ſo good that he gives us rain from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our hearts with food and gladnes, yea giveth us his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40764:98"/> and ordinances? he hath not ſo dealt with all his people. Is it not careleſneſſe in Gods worſhip to be careleſſe what we think therein, whether good or evil, whether impertinent good, or pertinent? Thus they rob God of a part of their ſoul, who hath made all, requires all, and deſerves all, That there is a common careleſneſſe in men of thoughts, appears in that they do not ſet their thoughts in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when they come to Gods worſhip, but rather bring that with them, which may diſtract them, <hi>viz.</hi> thoughts of meeting with ſuch and ſuch, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them about ſome worldly buſines: and when they are there, ſuffer their eies to wander and rove, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelves with variety of objects. They that take no
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40764:99"/> care of their eies, take no care of their thoughts, for the eies do feed the thoughts, the thoughts depend upon the eies. God out of his care of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and our good, ſpirituall, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and eternall, hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his worſhip: is it not our great ſin to be careleſſe of it? Our own thoughts will in time accuſe us, and paſſe this reproof upon us, when it ſhall be an evil day of affliction with us, or when the word ſhall be a light in our mindes, and a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in our hearts. Time of ſicknes is a time of thoughts, then our hands and feet are bound, onely our thoughts are at liberty, which will then toil and buſy themſelves about our wandring in good duties, and thereby vex and torment us. The more careleſſe we have
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40764:99"/> been of our thoughts in Gods worſhip, the more carefull will our thoughts be to diſquiet us, for conſcience muſt, and ſhall do its office, and there is more matter of diſquiet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The particular careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Gods people, of their thoughts in Gods worſhip, is particularly to be reproved, their mindes are in part ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they know the weight of Gods worſhip, the worth of good thoughts, the evil of wandring thoughts, how comfortable the one leaves the heart, and how ſad the other, yet they take but little care to keep their minde cloſe to Gods worſhip. I ſpeak not of that infirmity which doth follow neceſſarily upon the remainings of corruption, and is common to all the godly, ſome wandring thoughts in
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40764:100"/> good duties, but I ſpeak of their careleſſenes and negligence to prevent wandring thoughts, whereupon follows ſtore, and abundance of them. The former is their ſin, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable; wandring thoughts are the fruits of our ſin, our firſt voluntary Apoſtaſy from God, but this is an addition of ſin to ſin, an increaſe of ſin, not only a neglect of Gods worſhip, but alſo a neglect of our firſt injuring of God and his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip by our fall. For were we ſenſible of our ſinfull frame of minde, that doth as neceſſarily and naturally ſend out wandring thoughts, as the fire doth heat, were we troubled that we have brought upon our ſelves a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of wandring and roving from God in his worſhip, we would take care that this origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40764:100"/> corruption ſhould not be fruitfull. I appeal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the godly: do not your thoughts accuſe you for careleſſenes of your thoughts in Gods worſhip? Were there nothing elſe to convince the godly of the careleſſenes of their thoughts in Gods worſhip, and their fault therein, this were ſufficient, the fruit of their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts. What makes Sabbaths ſo weariſome to the godly, but this, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep their thoughts to God? the more the day and our thoughts ſuit, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and delight therein, and the leſſe out thoughts and the day ſuit, the more weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome the day will be. What makes the ordinances ſo unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable? the hearts of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are not affected in the word,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40764:101"/> in praier, becauſe of theſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts, as the thoughts are taken up about any thing, ſo the affections do work; if the thoughts be but ſleighty, the affections will be but ſleightly moved; if the thoughts be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſed with a thing, the affections are ſtrongly moved. Nay, what is the cauſe of Gods abſence in his worſhip, that the godly cannot ſee him, feel him, have communion with him? Surely wandring thoughts are the cauſe, if not all the cauſe, yet one cauſe, and a firſt cauſe, they carry away the ſoul from Gods worſhip, and leave only the body, and God is a ſpirit, and doth converſe with our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; if they be abſent, God all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo will be abſent, for there is no ſuitablenes between him and our bodies, a meer bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40764:101"/> is ſit onely for idol Gods, that are all body, God is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſpirituall worſhip only doth agree unto him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To teach the godly, and to preſſe them. 1. In their ſoul-ſearchings and examinations, to finde out their ſins, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their wandring thoughts in Gods worſhip, which are no ſmall part of the ſinne of their ſouls, eſpecially when we come to look over the manner of the performance of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, forget not our wandring thoughts, but conſider them, and look into them: theſe do as well robbe and ſpoil the worſhip of God of its due, as other ſins, theſe neglected in our hearts, may make God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us, and we not aware of the cauſe. The more theſe are removed from the ſight of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40764:102"/> others, the more need we have to look after them, becauſe they are the more eaſily overskipped and forgotten, they have the excuſe of ſecrecy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their humiliations, to humble their ſouls for their wandring thoughts, theſe are part of their ſin, an offence and injury to God, therefore ſhould be part of their humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Foure things conſidered may help our humiliation in this reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſin by wandring thoughts in all the ordinances of God, none excepted, in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wherein we come neereſt to God, when we ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higheſt majeſty of ſome things, our though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s are buſy about other things, yea in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary praier, when we ſpecially ſeparate our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40764:102"/> communion with God, and have nothing, or little to do with the creatures, leſt they ſhould hinder us in the worſhip of God, yet we cannot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelves from wandring thoughts: nor in the word, when God ſpeaks unto us: nor in the Sacraments, when we come to binde our ſelves from wandring thoughts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſin much by wandring thoughts in all parts of Gods worſhip. If our wandring and pertinent thoughts were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, for the moſt part, it were hard to ſay, which would be the moſt: ſo often do our hearts runne out in duty, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times long ſtay out ere they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, eſpecially in ſuch duties wherein we join with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be ſure our wandring thoughts would be found to be very many.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:40764:103"/>3. We continually &amp; at all times do much offend, by wandring thoughts in all parts of Gods worſhip, though ſometimes more then at other, yet all times much, not one time excepted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though we offend ſo much in all the ordinances of God, and ſo continually, yet we are but little ſenſible of our ſin this way. We complain of our other ſins in publique, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſecret, but litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e do we complain of this ſin, though we offend more and more continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by words ordeeds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To labour in the uſe of all appointed and ſanctified means to prevent wandring thoughts in Gods worſhip. Though we cannot altogether prevent them, yet let us do what we can: though we cannot attain to what we deſire, yet it will be
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40764:103"/> our comfort that we have done our duty. Is not my doctrine argument ſufficient, that they weaken Gods worſhip, <hi>i. e.</hi> make our praiers, hearing, crackt veſſels that they cannot hold and carry that meaſure of glory to God, that otherwiſe they would, nor that good to us? The very beſt thing we do, or can do, is to worſhip God. We do well when for Gods ſake we do right unto our neighbour, but we do beſt when we worſhip God, for we do that which is moſt his command, the other is the ſecond command, but this is the firſt and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; We do that which is moſt for Gods glory, we do that which is neareſt our work in heaven, for there we ſhall worſhip God, even when we ſhall have no outward works of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40764:104"/> juſtice or mercy to do one to another. Should we not be carefull to do our beſt work, the worſhip of God, in the beſt manner? and if in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then with as much of our hearts as may be, for they are the beſt part, then take we heed our thoughts do not wander. But beſide, let me uſe ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments to preſſe us to take heed of wandring thoughts in holy duties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They make a Chriſtian to play the part of an hypocrite in Gods worſhip: what is it to be an hypocrite, but to ſeem to be that which he is not? When we bring our bodies to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, we ſeem to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him earneſtly, but when our thoughts wander, we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, we ſeem to do that we do not, and therefore play
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40764:104"/> the part of an hypocrite: ſo much as our thoughts wander in good duties, ſo much do we as hypocrites do, though our hearts be ſincere, yet herein we play the part of hypocrites. This is contrary to the nature of grace, which deſires a man may have truth, though he have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, and may do what he doth in truth, though he do never ſo little, now the leſſe our hearts wander, the more truth we expreſſe in Gods worſhip, and the more truth, the more acceptable to Gods grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wandring thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves and their own nature, are a curſe. God may, and certainly doth ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify them to his own people, to be means of humiliation, of watchfulnes, of more depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Chriſt, but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40764:105"/> they are a curſe. For what is a curſe but ſeparation from God, the fountain of bleſſing, the fountain of good, in whoſe preſence is all good, nothing but good, and out of whoſe preſence is all evil, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but evil? <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart, ye curſed,</hi> therefore cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe they muſt depart from God, never to come near him again. Wandring thoughts they do carry the heart from God. God comes near to his people in his worſhip, wandring thoughts do carry the heart farre from the worſhip of God, therefore farre from God. So ſaith God, <hi>they draw neer me with their mouths, and honour me with their lips, but their hearts are removed farre from me:</hi> and the firſt inſtrument of removing of the heart, is the wandring of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40764:105"/> the thoughts. Will not the name of a curſe prevail with us, to perſwade us to take heed of wandring thoughts? Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider when wandring thoughts come to us in holy duties, the curſe comes, and when they ſtay with us, the curſe ſtaies with us. We come to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God for a bleſſing, and to have a curſe inſtead of a bleſſing in time of bleſſing, is a double curſe. Prophane ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <hi>Eſau,</hi> when the bleſſing was denied him, he lift up his voice and wept, he had ſo much underſtanding, that he thought the bleſſing was worthy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, though it coſt dear. So on the contrary, wandring thoughts being a curſe, are worthy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, though it coſt us tears to God, yea many tears, and much pains with our own hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:40764:106"/>3. The Lord hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to puniſh theſe wandring thoughts, which carry away the heart in his worſhip, and make it only a bodily exerciſe without ſpirit and life, with a ſecret but ſure blaſting of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpirituall good, that as God hath but a ſhadow and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of worſhip; ſo they ſhall have but a ſhadow, and ſhew of ſpirituall wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.14. <hi>Therefore the wiſdom of the wiſe ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of the prudent ſhall be hid.</hi> Therefore, why? Becauſe they have drawn neer to God with their mouths, and have removed their hearts farre from him. They gave God a body without an heart, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will give them a body without an heart, the ſhape of wiſe men without wiſdom and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:40764:106"/> prudence, a ſuitable judgement. What is the reaſon that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſo much ſhadows and ſhews of Chriſtians, rather then ſubſtance and truth? when they ſhould come to bear injuries and wrongs, to forget and forgive, they can do it no more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men: when they ſhould expreſſe their dependance upon God, and ſubmiſſion unto God, in willing and chearfull part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with comforts and friends, when God will have it ſo, they can no more do it then other men, they hold comforts faſt, as if they ſhould part with God and all, when they part with them, and they hold friends faſt, and will not let them go, as if friends were made more to ſerve one another, then to ſerve God, and when friends and comforts are gon, they grieve
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:40764:107"/> as if all their joy were gone. When they ſhould bear quietly the croſſe and grieving paſſages of Gods providence, as thoſe who have learned in whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtate they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, knowing they are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines if need be, they cannot bear, but carry themſelves as untamed heifers, that would rather ſhake off the yoke, then bear it: they have the ſhew of theſe graces in their profeſſion, but they want that meaſure of ſubſtance, the reaſon is, becauſe their ſervice of God is more in ſhew then ſubſtance, therefore they are Chriſtians more in ſhew then ſubſtance. As we ſpend our Sabbaths, ſo will our week daies be ſpent, and as we perform holy duties, ſo will our converſation be. Is it not a heavy judgement to be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:40764:107"/> worſe then we think our ſelves, or others think us to be? to be unable to uſe grace, when we have moſt need to exerciſe it? yet thus hath God threatned to afflict us, and he will make his Word good, if we ſuffer our thoughts to wander in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> By what means may we prevent wandrings in Gods worſhip?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt labour the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace: <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. <hi>It is good that the heart be eſtabliſhed with grace, i. e.</hi> with g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>acious knowledge of old and well known truths, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle oppoſeth to new and ſtrange doctrine. And when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle would direct the people of God to keep their own ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, yea though the errour of the wicked took courſe to draw
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40764:108"/> them away. He gives them counſell to grow in grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.17, 18. Which places do ſhew, that grace is of an eſtabliſhing, ſetling nature, and ſo indeed it is, for</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is contrary to vanity and inconſtancy, being the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, who is ſtable and firm, alwaies one and the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſets the ſoul in order, puts every faculty into its place, and ſets it about its own proper office, and ſo it doth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It doth eſtabliſh, as it is the work of the free or liberall ſpirit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12. <hi>David</hi> prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God would eſtabliſh him with his free ſpirit: grace doth eſtabliſh a man as it is the work of the free ſpirit, becauſe it maketh a mans ſpirit free and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40764:108"/> liberall, like to the ſpirit of God, to ſleight earthly things in compariſon, and to minde heaven and heavenly things: earthly things do unſettle, they are themſelves changeable, and do change the thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections pitched upon them. Let a man pitch his thoughts and heart upon his neareſt friends he hath in the world, to whom nature, ſociety, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of love, Chriſtianity hath bound him, yet his thoughts and affections placed upon theſe neareſt friends, ſhall change, and not alwaies conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue one and the ſame; becauſe they change, and are not alwaies the ſame, therefore the thoughts pitched upon them, do change alſo; ſpirituall and heavenly things are of the nature of the ſpirit and heaven, ſteady and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40764:109"/> ſtable, immoveable, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, therefore will eſtabliſh the affections pitched upon them. Now the more grace we have, the more we ſhall minde heavenly things, and ſo be the more eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour the increaſe of thy reverence and high eſteem of the worſhip of God. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy thoughts of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, ſo much-what will thy thoughts be in it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.9. <hi>We have thought of thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindnes, oh God, in the midſt of thy Temple.</hi> They profeſſe their thoughts were buſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Gods loving kindnes in his Ordinances: why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their high thoughts thereof, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>beautifull for ſituation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion: God is known in her palaces for a refuge.</hi> And
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40764:109"/> herein were they helped by the report of their fathers, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>as we have heard, ſo have we ſeen in the City of the Lord of hoſts:</hi> they had ſeen Gods mighty preſence and protection, in and about his own Ordinances, but they had alſo heard ſo, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had ſeen it. To help our reverence of Gods worſhip, it is good to talk with ancient Chriſtians, that have lived long before us, to hear what they will ſay; we may be helped by their experience, when we have none, or but little of our own, and if we have experience of the worth of the Ordinances, we may be further helped by their experience.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Prepare our ſelves afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.1. Through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a man having ſeparated himſelf, intermedleth with all
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40764:110"/> wiſdom, if a man have a deſire to meddle with matters of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and would do it as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſuch occaſions, and as may be for profit, he will firſt ſeparate himſelf, not paſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from common and triviall matters, to matters of wiſdom, but he will have ſome time betwixt the leaving off of the one, and taking to the other. If we paſſe from our callings to Gods worſhip without ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves, how is it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily poſſible, but that we ſhould have the ſame thoughts in Gods worſhip, that we bad in our callings? There are ſome ſeparating duties that do prepare unto others, as examination, meditation, praier, and they do prepare, by ſtirring up the grace of God, and providing an heavenly aſſiſtance to begin
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40764:110"/> with us in the duty. If thou canſt not alwaies have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting time, betwixt other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Gods worſhip; Yet have ſome ſeparating thoughts ere thou enter upon the duty, thou art not fit elſe to meddle with wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Accuſtom our ſelves to meditation, ſo we ſhall get a skill of thinking well. Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its nature, is the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſetling, and congealing of our thoughts. It is to our roving ſluent mindes, as a damme to running water: when much water is gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the damme makes it there to ſtand: So when many thoughts are gathered together in the ſoul, meditation makes them there to ſtand, keeps them from running out again. The nature of it being a ſetling of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40764:111"/> the minde: the effect of it muſt needs be ſo, and the uſe of it frequently muſt needs perfect the effect, more and more ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our mindes. When <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to have a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alwaies, the means he uſed, was to exerciſe himſelf therein, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Exerciſe thy ſelf unto godlines:</hi> the way to gain the trade and skill of godlines, is to exerciſe our ſelves therein: <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly unto them, that thy profiting may appear unto all.</hi> If <hi>Timothy</hi> would be buſied whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſtirring up the gift of God, all ſhould ſee his profiting. So if we would give our ſelves to meditation, be much in it, it would apparently ſettle our mindes. It is made the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a bleſſed meditating man,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40764:111"/> to bring forth fruit in ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.3. Why ſo? becauſe he is as a tree planted by the rivers of waters. As a tree planted by the rivers of waters, cannot want fitnes to bring forth fruit in ſeaſon, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cauſe it hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of nouriſhment: So the meditating ſoul cannot want fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to bring forth fruit in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, good thoughts in holy duties, becauſe it is planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gods ſprings, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the aſſiſting ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde to theſe watchfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: wandring thoughts will not be prevented without watching. Watch</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thy minde; it needs watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for it is nimble, therefore will ſoon be gone, and go far in a little time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Watch thine eie: a rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eie, a wandring heart: if
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:40764:112"/> thou give libertie to thy eie, that will ſet the minde at liberty, <hi>Job.</hi> 31.1. I have made a Covenant with mine eies, why ſhould I think on a maid? the eie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the minde, elſe why ſhould he make one Covenant to binde them both? So he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, I have made a covenant with mine eies, why ſhould I think? It might be ſaid, though the eie be bound by covenant, yet the minde is at liberty. The anſwer is, that the eie is the ſervant of the minde, made to help that, therefore in binding the eie, the minde is bound, for if it cannot have the help and ſervice of the eie, it hath not full liberty: if the minde ſhould not be bound, why ſhould the eie to which it ſerves?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Watch thy ears: when thou art hearing or praying, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:40764:112"/> will cauſe ſome ſound or other to draw away thy ear, he is that cunning charmer that labours to inchant our ears, he will make us think that we hear ſome pleaſant melody, of our profit, or pleaſure, or honour, if we keep not our ears ſtopped with attention, thickned with watchfullnes.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Watch thy affections,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they be affected and moved with the duty in hand; dead affections make a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring minde: if what is thought on do not affect, the minde will think of ſomething elſe that may affect: this is one reaſon of wandring thoughts, becauſe preſent thoughts do not affect: the minde doth naturally ſerve the affections, the more they are delighted, the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the minde hath, for it hath
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40764:113"/> its ende, if duties in hand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not, the minde will wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der till it hath found matter of delight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Watch thy affections, that they continue as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, if they be affected. A bowe continuing bent, doth carry the arrow levell to the mark, but if it ſlip, the arrow wanders: So if our affections continue in that vigour and life wherein they begin, they will keep our mindes ſteady, but if our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions tire, and wax weary, our mindes will rove. Though by watchfulnes we cannot wholly prevent wandring thoughts, yet we ſhall in part prevent them: hereby we ſhall more eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them, and reſiſt them: this is a way of command, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſure way.</p>
               <p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His verſe doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us an help, and means to the better praiſing of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> fixednes, firmnes, or preparation of heart and ſoul: which gives us juſt ground to ſpeak of another hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of our earneſt worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40764:114"/> of God, <hi>viz.</hi> unſetlednes, looſenes, and unpreparednes of heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> God cannot ſo well be worſhipped, without a fixed or prepared heart: unpreparednes of heart doth weaken our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God. What is ſaid of thankſgiving, which is one part of Gods worſhip, is true of all, for there is the ſame reaſon of one, and of all. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of heart doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend all thankſgiving even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God himſelf, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner doth it commend all other parts of worſhip, and the want of it doth diſcommend the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip performed, and therefore diſcommend it, becauſe it doth weaken it, for had the worſhip its full and due ſtrength, and worth without it, how ſhould the want thereof diſcommend?
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40764:115"/> But this is clear in the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. That worſhip that is performed with a ſleepy drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy body, is a weak worſhip, but the Pſalmiſt here makes the awaking of the body, to be the fruit, and effect of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart, awake my glory, awake lute and harp, I my ſelf will awake early: why ſo? My heart is prepared: the heart prepared and thereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, will awake the body. To worſhip God therefore without a prepared heart, is to worſhip him with a drouſy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, becauſe with a drouſy heart, and therefore weakly.</p>
               <p>Three things will fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the truth of this point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The command of God for preparation, ſee it both in ordinary, and in extraordinary worſhip. God requires prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40764:115"/> unto ordinary worſhip. A generall command that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto all parts of ordinary worſhip, expreſſely is the fourth Commandement. There are foure things in that, which do call for preparation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Remember the Sabbath day, and he that ſetteth down no particular time when we ſhould remember it, means all time, a ſigne there is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more in that day then in other daies, that we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it more then any other, yea then all other, ſurely for ſome end we muſt remember it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Keep it holy, and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. The Lord ſanctified it: there is a difference between this and other daies: we may and muſt ſpend them in our own occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, but we muſt keep it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40764:116"/> as a day ſet a part for his glory, and how ſhall we keep the day holy, if we our ſelves be unholy?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.10. The Lords day, he hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it for himſelf: the ſix daies are our daies, allowed us for our occaſions, and ſhall we make no difference between Gods day and our own? If the King will have the coronation day, kept as his day? If a Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord will have his marriage be kept as his day? we difference the ſame by change of apparell: and ſhall we not difference Gods day from other daies by change of ſpirit?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Six daies thou ſhalt labour and do all thou hast to do,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>In it thou ſhalt do no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of work;</hi> What is this but a
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40764:116"/> charge to prepare, when we are commanded to get all our earthly occaſions diſpatched, ere that day come? And if it be a difficulty ſo to do, yet we muſt labour, and take pains for that end, and if we muſt have none of our occaſions to do on the Lords day, which are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full all the ſix daies, much leſſe muſt we have our ſinfull occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to do on that day, which are never lawfull. Another gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall place is, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt to the houſe of God.</hi> It is ſpirituall worſhip chiefly that is performed in Gods houſe, therefore it is a ſpirituall foot that is here chiefly meant, and the foot of the ſoul, is the inclination or diſpoſition of the ſoul, for all the faculties of the ſoul do move, and work by the diſpoſitions thereof, good or
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40764:117"/> evil, by them we walk towards God, and converſe with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19, 20. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the wicked, ſaith, they minde earthly things, but of the godly he ſaith, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is in heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> as men by the help of their feet, carrying them from place to place, do converſe amongſt men; ſo the godly by means of their underſtanding do walk to heaven, though they live here upon earth, do converſe with God. The feet of the ſoul muſt be kept, when we goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of God, then our minde, will and affections, muſt be in ſpeciall compaſſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſpeciall command: and that will not be without preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we have them not at a beck. As the Scripture doth plainly command in generall, that we
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40764:117"/> prepare unto all the worſhip of God, ſo doth it plainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand preparation, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parts of Gods worſhip. For hearing the Word of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Break up the fallow ground of your hearts, and ſowe not among thornes:</hi> The ground, the heart, muſt be prepared by the plow of repentance, the very inwards of the heart muſt be faſtned and opened thereby, and the weeds plucked up by the roots, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>Take heed how you hear, it muſt be done with caution, not with careleſnes,</hi> he doth not ſay, you need not heed how you hear, but take heed how you hear. For praier, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, nor let thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God,</hi> we muſt not ruſh upon praier, nor raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pour out words in that
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40764:118"/> duty, but be well adviſed and ponder well what we ſay. For ſinging pſalms: be filled with the ſpirit, and then ſing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.18, 19. For the paſſover: <hi>the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall lamb was not to be killed till the fourteenth day of the moneth:</hi> Exod. 12.6. <hi>but it was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up on the tenth day, ver.</hi> 3. What was this but to prepare them? The paſchall lamb was ſet apart foure daies before the celebration of the paſſeover. So in regard of the Lords ſupper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 21.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> not firſt eat, and then examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The like command we may finde for extraordinary parts of Gods worſhip. When the people were to hear the Word from Gods own mouth, he commanded, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.10, 11. <hi>That they ſhould be ſanctified two
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40764:118"/> daies together, Go ſanctify the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to day and to morrow, and be ready against the third day:</hi> Joel 2.15, 16. <hi>Sanctify a Faſt:</hi> and how ſhall the people be fitted? <hi>Sanctify the Congregation.</hi> When God was about to bring inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible evil upon his people, and would ſet them an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all way to prevent it, he bids them prepare to meet him, meet him, but not without prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. The like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand lies upon vows, which are the companions of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſpeciall praier, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6. The ſumme of this firſt argument, to prove, that the want of preparation doth weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the worſhip of God, is this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To want that which God hath commanded as an help to his worſhip, ordinary and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, is to weaken that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40764:119"/> But to want preparation, is to want that which God hath appointed as an help to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ordinary, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: therefore to want prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to weaken that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The examples of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God agreeable to this command, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.6. <hi>I will waſh mine hands in innocency, ſo will I compaſſe thine Altar, oh God: David</hi> alludeth to a command injoined to the Prieſts, who ſerved at the Altar, <hi>viz.</hi> to waſh their hands and their feet, when they went to do the ſervice of the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20. This no doubt was exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary to the people, to teach them with what preparation they ſhould worſhip God, and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, he will waſh his hands in innocency, <hi>i. e.</hi> put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40764:119"/> the evil of his doings, and then come to worſhip God, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15, 16. God excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their duties, becauſe their hands were full of blood, cruell hands, and muſt be waſhed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.6. It was <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> command, that the Prieſts ſhould prepare themſelves, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify their brethren againſt the paſſeover: what a pithy letter did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> write to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, to fit them for the paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. A letter of inſtruction, ſhewing them how they ſhould prepare themſelves, a letter of exhortation, preſſing them thereto, a letter of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhewing the benefits that would thence flow, and vvhen he perceived the peoples hearts vvere prepared, yet they vvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ceremoniall preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he vvas not ſatisfied, but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40764:120"/> praied to the Lord to heal them.</p>
               <p>Notable vvas <hi>Jacobs</hi> care to fit his family for a day of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thankſgiving, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.1, 2. and if he were ſo carefull to prepare many, ſurely he was not careleſſe of one, of himſelf: He ſaid to his houſehold, Put away the ſtrange Gods that are amongſt you, and be clean, and change your garments; put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſtrange Gods, more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and groſſe ſins; be clean from more ſecret ſins, change your garments, the frame of their hearts from earthly to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. When he was in danger, ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord, and proclaimed a Faſt, turned his face from other occaſions, and ſet it towards that great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. From this argument we may reaſon thus.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:40764:120"/>
               <p>To neglect that which the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have practiſed, as a way of due worſhipping of God, is to weaken that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>But to neglect preparation, is to neglect that which the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God have practiſed, as a way of due worſhipping God. Therefore to neglect preparation, is to weaken that worſhip.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath generally put it into the mindes of men, as a point of wiſdom, to make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for matters of leſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. prepare thy work without, and make it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for thy ſelf in the field, and afterwards build thine houſe. When men build an houſe, they firſt bring materialls to the hill, (as we ſay) and then fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thoſe materialls, that they
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40764:121"/> may ſit the work intended, and then they build, they do not build without preparation, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21.31. <hi>The horſe is prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of battell;</hi> the horſe is not uſed in battell out of hand, nor will any ordinary common horſe ſerve for that end, <hi>but the horſe is prepared againſt the day of battell,</hi> by exerciſing unto war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like skill, by fit keeping, by harneſſing. Men prepare their ground by mannuring and plowing, ere they caſt in the ſeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.24, 25, 26. Doth the plow-man plow all day to ſowe? doth he open and break the clods of his ground? when he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not caſt abroad the ſirches, and ſcatter the cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, and caſt in the principall wheat, and the appointed bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and the rie in their place?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40764:121"/> And why doth he thus prepare the ground, ere he ſowe? <hi>ver.</hi> 26. for his God doth inſtruct him unto diſcretion, and doth teach him. Is it wiſdom to prepare, ere we build a materiall houſe for man to dwell in? And is it not much more wiſdom to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for that houſe, that it want nothing, which muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the God of heaven? Iſa. 66.1, 2. <hi>Heaven and earth are Gods, he hath made them, and they are ready prepared:</hi> but what houſe will they make for God? The Lord tells them what houſe he chuſeth more then heaven and earth. To him will I look, that is poor and contrite, and that trembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let me adde one inſtance more, which comes a little more nearer to the matter in hand. When we are to come to the houſe of God, we prepare our bodies, in regard of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany we come unto, we waſh our ſelves, and change our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, and ſee that it be clean, we put on ſome clothes that were not worne ſince they were waſhed, but are pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe grace in the heart, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of theſe alone will bring perfection of fitnes to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God. We on earth pray that we may doe Gods will as it is done in heaven; onely they that are in heaven are a perfect paterne of worſhiping God. Nay I appeale to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the people of God, when they have endeavoured to renew their repentance, to pitch their thoughts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon heavenly things, to ſtirre up their graces, and doe l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40764:137"/> what they have, there is ſuch difference between the one and the other. If the ſoul prepared hath but a meaſure of fitnes, yea but a ſmall meaſure, then a ſoul without preparation cannot be fit at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We cannot be fit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God without preparation, becauſe we continually disfit our ſelves between time and time of Gods ſervice. In the generall, the fleſh doth luſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit unceſſantly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. As grace doth make a man willing to worſhip God, and deſirous to be imploied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that; ſo corruption, on the contrary, doth make a man backward thereto, nay forward to ſin, this is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.21. <hi>When I would do good, evil is preſent with me.</hi> When his regenerate will chuſeth
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40764:137"/> good, his unregenerate will out of hand chuſeth evil. And the effect of this luſting of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, is this, (ſaith the Apoſtle) ye cannot do what ye would, though there be a will to be prepared for duty, yet the corrupt will, will hinder the act of the regenerate will, or at leaſt weaken it. More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, we do continually unfit our ſelves for the worſhip of God two waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſin continually in all our actions, and every act of ſin doth ſtrengthen the habit, and weaken the contrary habit of grace. Not only we do ſin neceſſarily and unavoidably, but through careleſnes, for want of watching to avoid occaſions, and to take hold of advantages againſt ſin. And the more of the will in ſin, the leſſe oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40764:138"/> it meeteth with all, the more doth it gather ſtrength, and weaken grace, becauſe grace is leſſe exerciſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.2. <hi>Your iniquities have ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and your God:</hi> Sin doth not only ſeparate us from God, as a fountain of comfort, but as a fountain of grace, ſo that the more we ſin, the leſſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we have with God in grace, and the leſſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we have with God in grace, the more unfit to worſhip him. It fares with us in this caſe, as with <hi>Samſon,</hi> when he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way that the hair of his head ſhould be cut, which was to break his covenant, (a ſin rather of careleſnes, then of preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption) he thought to have riſen up, and gon from the Philiſtines as at other times, but he knew not that God was departed from
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40764:138"/> him: ſin had bereaved him of his ſtrength: So when we have been careleſſe of our watch, as we generally are, and have let looſe our thoughts, affections, ſpeeches, we think to pray, hear, meditate, with the ſame ſpirituall life and ſtrength, that we have formerly done, but we know not that God is abſent from our hearts, and ſo our ſtrength is abſent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We do ſpecially unfit our ſelves for Gods worſhip by the uſe of our callings, and the comforts of this life. Neither our callings nor outward good things do of themſelves unfit us to worſhip God, for God would not then have given man a calling, and ſet him in midſt of outward comforts in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. But we abuſe our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and comforts, to make us

               <p n="2">2. We beſtow too much time upon our callings: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.2. <hi>It is vain for you to riſe early, to ſit up late,</hi> ſhewing that ordinarily our care is to gain all time for our callings and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, hardly can we ſpare time daily for the worſhip of God, and when the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The foundation of their refuſing to come to the ſupper, the ordinances of God, was this, they could not ſpare time from their callings.</p>
               <p>We beſtow too much pains and labour about our callings, too much ſpend the vigour and ſtrength of our bodies, that they become unfit to ſerve our ſouls in the worſhip of God. What means our ſleepy praiers every night in our families, but the over-wearying of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies?

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40764:141"/> of our bodies on the week daies?</p>
               <p n="3">3. We cannot be fit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God without preparation, becauſe of Satans continuall main endeavour to make us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Gods worſhip; Satan is more Gods enemy then ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſtands more directly oppoſite unto him then we do. God is the greateſt good: Satan is the greateſt evil. What is more oppoſite to the greateſt good, then the greateſt evil? We have ſomewhat like Satan, therefore he is not ſo great an enemy unto us: God is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlike him, and contrary to him, therefore he is an utter enemy to him; ſo that though Satan will endeavour to unſit us for our own callings, yet chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Gods worſhip, for that doth moſt concern Gods glory,

Whereas the burden of duty is too heavy, the ſpirit
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:40764:142"/> of God doth help to lift the burden. If the ſoul come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedly, the ſpirit of God will not ordinarily aſſiſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe a leſſer breathing of the ſpirit is neglected: and will the ſpirit lay out more, when leſſer is not prized and improved? The ſpirit of God doth allwaies move and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the ſoul unto all the will of God, and therefore unto preparation, if men therefore come without preparation, they come w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th neglect of the ſpirits motion unto preparation; and if leſſe of the ſpirit be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, will he be laviſh of more aſſiſtance?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpirit will not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily aſſiſt the unprepared heart, becauſe it is out of the way and road of the ſpirit: the ſpirit of God is a ſpirit of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:40764:143"/> 1.13. and is therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to the ſoul in a way o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> promiſe, but the unprepared heart is out of the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and therefore out of the way of the ſpirit. Indeed the ſpirit of God will ſometimes meet an unprepared heart in a duty, but it goeth out of the ordinary way at ſuch a time, as it muſt do when we are out of the way; the ſpirit of God muſt firſt come out of its ordinary way to us, ere we can get into our way; but the effect of the ſpirit meeting a ſoul unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is to make it aſhamed of unpreparednes, and more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thereunto for time to come.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unpreparednes of heart doth weaken our worſhiping of God, as it doth give advantage to Satan to interrupt and hinder
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40764:143"/> us in the ſame. To what end ſerves preparation? is not this a main end to prevent impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in worſhip, and Satan the maſter of them? When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. would have us be vigilant, upon this ground, that Satan walketh about, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he may devoure, doth he not give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the more careleſſe we are, the more advantage Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath againſt us, and the more watchfull we are, the leſſe harme can he doe us? This was our Saviours counſell to his three diſciples in the garden in the very houre of temptation, <hi>watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> implying, that it is not ſufficient for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Satans temptations to performe dueties, unleſſe we adde watching, that we be fit
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40764:144"/> to performe them. It is not due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that weaken Satan, but due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties performed in the power of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal</hi> 5.16. <hi>walke in the ſpirit, and ye ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh:</hi> ſo much as we expreſſe the ſpirit, we oppoſe ſin and Satan. The devil makes great advantage of dueties, of mens hearing, reading, praying. Into whom doth he enter with the unclean ſpirit, but into the houſe that is ſwept of groſſe and foule ſinnes, and garniſhed with common gilts and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of dueties? The ſcribes and Phariſees made a cloke of their long prayers to cover their oppreſſion. The devil himſelf will ſometimes put on the forme of an Angel of light: and herein doe his inſtruments imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, as a way of more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall deceiving, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:40764:144"/> 14, 15. ſo that duties perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unpreparedly do more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage Satan then otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>But that we may ſee more fully how unpreparednes of heart doth give advantage unto Satan, let us enter into ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The heart unprepared is indiſpoſed unto good duties, hath no readines unto them, but diſpoſed unto other things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne, or unto worldly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: the ſoul is ever working, becauſe it is ſometimes indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to good duties, it is not therefore indiſpoſed to every thing elſe, but it ſtands inclined to other things. Now no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the ſoul is ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Satan, as a diſpoſition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is good, for that is Gods image, and the devil can make leaſt advantage of it,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:40764:145"/> for though he make great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of good duties, yet for the moſt part it is when the heart is indiſpoſed; but when the heart is unprepared, and ſo hath no readines unto that which is good, but rather unto other things, it doth come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the devils diſpoſition, and ſo gives more advantage to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; it is more fit to cloſe with his ſuggeſtions, and unfit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the heart is unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, the ſpirit of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne, for that is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall cauſe of the unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the heart, the abſence of the ſpirit, and if the ſpirit be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in any meaſure, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemy and oppoſite of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is abſent, the light and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſoul is abſent, light to diſcerne Temptations, and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:40764:145"/> power to reſiſt them; and if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath the advantage of the darknes and weaknes of the ſoul, hath he not great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unpreparednes of heart doth weaken the grace of faith, whereby we ſhould draw ſtrength from Chriſt, both to perform duty, and to reſiſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations in duty. The ground of faith is the promiſe: unpreparednes of heart doth take the ſoul out of the way of the promiſe, therefore takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ground of ſaith; and faith being weakned, Satans temptations are ſtrengthened, for faith is the ſhield that quencheth the fiery darts of the Devil, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. The leſſe uſe of faith in the heart, the more fire in Satans temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:40764:146"/>4. As unpreparednes of heart doth weaken faith, ſo at the ſame time it doth weaken the comfort of the ſoul, and bring in doubts in the room thereof: ſo much want of faith in the heart, ſo much want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: if the ſoul be out of the way of aſſiſtance in duty, as in unpreparednes it is, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or chear can it have to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the worſhip of God? It will be full of doubts and fears, and that will be Satans advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for as the joy of the Lord is our ſtrength, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.10. ſo the ſorrow of the heart, and doubt of the heart, is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the heart, and that is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans advantage. The heart all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready doubting, is ſit to have doubts multiplied by Satan, the doubts of the ſoul do darken the ſoul, and ſo Satan may with
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:40764:146"/> leſſe notice and diſcerning ſcatter his temptations in the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> This doctrine doth prove foure things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The fall; The worſhip of God cannot be ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſervants of God without preparation, a ſigne they are not alwaies fit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, a ſigne of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection: and imperfection is a ſigne of their fall. Did God ſend us out of his hand imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? If we were perfect, we had no unpreparednes unto that which is good. God made us in his image and likenes, and Gods image is ready and free unto that which is good: we are not therefore as we were made. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, we are his workmanſhip, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in Chriſt Jeſus unto good
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:40764:147"/> works, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. our firſt creation unto good works, was not in Chriſt Jeſus: but before we can have any diſpoſednes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is good, we muſt be created again through the power of the Lord Jeſus: we are not therefore the ſame cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were at firſt, but have loſt it: and the ſigne hereof we carry continually about us, an unreadines to that which is good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The evil of the fall. What greater evil, then to be allwaies out of frame to what is good, any further then the heart is ſet in temper? All evils of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment do ſpring from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of the heart, and are appointed to puniſh that, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is greater then them all. It is the Lords greateſt good, and ſo his greateſt glory
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:40764:147"/> to be allwaies diſpoſed unto good, and never unto evil. And it is the greateſt evil that the fall hath brought upon us, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we are allwaies diſpoſed unto evil, but never unto good, and when we are regenerate, we are allwaies more ready unto evil then unto good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The miſerable eſtate of unregenerate perſons, ſuch as are in the ſame eſtate wherein they were borne. If Gods people that are new creatures, that have Gods image renewed in them, cannot be fit to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, till they have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their hearts, and ſtirred up grace unto particular act and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, how ſhould they be ſit to worſhip God that have no grace at all, no generall reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? Unregenerate men may read, pray, hear the word, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40764:148"/> the Sacraments, but they can never be fit for thoſe duties, whilſt they remain in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate eſtate. And what a miſery is it to be unfit for Gods ſervice, which is the beſt work we can do, a work we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repent of, a work that tends to Gods glory, and to our beſt good? And the miſery is the greater, if we conſider, unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men are fit for any thing elſe, but to ſerve God: fit for their own occaſions, fit to ſin againſt God, they are wiſe to do evil, but to do well they have no underſtanding, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.12. put the caſe that a ſubject ſhould finde himſelf fit to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny buſines of his own, yea alſo fit to warre againſt his Prince, but unfit to do him any ſervice: would he not think himſelf in a miſerable temper? Nay, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40764:148"/> a man ſhould finde himſelf unfit to do for the beſt friend he hath in the world, that which he would have him to do, and what might pleaſure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, but fit to do the minde of his greateſt enemy, would he not think himſelf in an evil and lamentable temper? So it is with unregenerate men, they are fit to do their own occaſions, fit to do againſt Gods minde, and againſt Gods honour, but unfit to do for him, yea fit to do for their greateſt enemy, Satan, but unfit to do for God their greateſt friend: and is not this an evil temper? who would reſt in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The neceſſity of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration unto glory. If Gods worſhip cannot be ſo well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40764:149"/> without particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, then it cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed well at all, where there is no preparation, as in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate there is not. And can they be fit for heaven, that are not fit for Gods ſervice? What? fit for wages, and not fit for work? They that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the inheritance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, have it among them that are ſanctified, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. and what is it to be ſanctified by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, but to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part unto God and his ſervice, to be purified for Chriſt, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works? <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. Change of place will not change the diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſition of the ſoul, no not heaven it ſelf, could an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man come thither, no more then a man comming from hell, and relating his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall knowledge of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40764:149"/> torments there, would change the ſoul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.31. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men be unfit for the ſervice of God here, they will be much more unfit for the ſervice of God in heaven, where more perfection, and continuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God is required.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To reprove the uſuall and ordinary, generall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unpreparednes of Gods people unto Gods worſhip. It is not the fault of ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians onely, but of all the people of God generally, and their fault it is not, at ſome particular times onely, but or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily. No one thing, I am perſwaded, the godly are more failing in, then in preparing themſelves for Gods worſhip. They cannot be ignorant that it is a way of Gods command, and a way of promiſe, therefore of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40764:150"/> advantage and benefit unto them, therefore in neglecting it, they ſin againſt Gods ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their own good. Do not the practices of Gods ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſervants in Scripture caſt ſhame upon them? Nay, do not their own conſciences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, when they are out of temper in holy duties, and cannot finde God? Do not their conſciences whiſper to them, and tell them that they may thank their unpreparednes? Nay, doth not the thing it ſelf deeply reprove them, and take away all excuſe? what, come unprepared to Gods worſhip? Suppoſe that God would not at all hide himſelf, when his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come unprepared to his worſhip, and they were ſure of ſo much; yet were it their fault to come unprepared: ſhould not
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:40764:150"/> they ſuit themſelves according to the preſence they come unto, and the work they go about? Doth not reaſon teach as much? Can we without fault leſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for eternall waies, for waies that concern Gods glory, and our good moſt, then for other matters? Gods worſhip is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall way: though this and that particular worſhip of God be not eternall, yet ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God is eternall, and ſhall remain with us for ever in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all the worſhip of God doth tend more to Gods glory and our good, then any thing elſe; yet we prepare more for any thing elſe. More particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly we are to be reproved for ſundry things that tend to our unfitting to the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The godly do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:40764:151"/> the ſabbath in the week day. That remember, which the Lord hath prefixed before that commandement, rather then any other, doth imply, as a neceſſity of ſpeciall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that, ſo an eaſines to forget that, a difficulty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it, or elſe the Lord would not have ſet this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before it. And if the godly conſider, they ſhall finde, that the Sabbath comes ſeldome into their mindes the week thorow, though it be the moſt ſolemne day in the week, and of more weight then all the dayes in the week.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The godly do not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily keepe up their watch, and ſo advantages for grace are overſlipped, and ſinne is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through careleſſenes, which doth exceedingly unfit
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:40764:151"/> the heart for Gods worſhip: ſinne makes grace unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of duty as a knife to cut without an edge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They do not ſpiritualize their callings and earthly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, by going about them in the ſtrength and wiſdome of the ſpirit of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding Gods glory as their aime and end, and making ſome ſpirituall uſe of paſſages therein by meditation, often raiſing up their thoughts and deſires to heaven, ſo that they grow earthly and carnall, like the occaſions they meddle with, and ſo unfit for heavenly and ſpirituall worſhip.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The times of their vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie from their callings, and of libertie, they ſpend in empty and unprofitable wayes, letting looſe their thoughts and ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:40764:152"/> unto vain and empty things, which tend to no profit, and ſo the heart is more empty: whereas if the people of God would but ſeaſon the times of their repaſt and recreation, with ſome ſprinklings of good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as ſalt, or winde up the ſame with ſome good diſcourſe, or with prayer, or with ſome heavenly thoughts, their bodies would be more fit for Gods worſhip, and their ſpirits not the more unfit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The people of God do their worldly occaſions unto the utmoſt period of time, on the Saturday night, that ſleepe will allow them to take, and doe not improve their time that day, that they might get their occaſions diſpatched, and have ſome time to prepare their hearts.</p>
               <pb n="281" facs="tcp:40764:152"/>
               <p>Herein, I perſwade my ſelf, the godly that uſe our Saturday markets, do exceedingly faile, in that they do come home ſo late, not through neceſſity of buſines, but careleſſenes, much time is ſpent on that day which they can give no good account of, when they come to recollect themſelves. Nothing but ſleepe doth part the Lords day and their dayes with them, beſide ordinary duties. Will ſleepe change the frame? No ſurely, but as they left with the world laſt when they went to ſleepe, ſo they ſhall meet with that firſt when they awake in the morning. That which may the more reprove the godly, is the conſideration of a treble cauſe of this unpreparednes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The difficulty of it: it is an harder matter to prepare the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:40764:153"/> heart, then to performe a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for the godly do not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily neglect duties, but they ordinarily neglect to prepare their hearts: were it as eaſie to prepare the heart, as to performe duty, they would doe that as well. And if difficulty hinder, is not ſpirituall ſloth the cauſe? and what more lothſome, then to neglect that which might exceedingly tend to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their good, for want of taking a little paines?</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond cauſe, why the godly doe no more prepare themſelves, is, an opinion that a little preparation will ſerve: for if they did not thinke a little would ſerve, if they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that God would not take a little well, they would prepare more. And if this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion did ſpring from meere ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:40764:153"/> becauſe they know no better, it were leſſe matter; but it doth ſpring from heedleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and careleſſenes, becauſe they do not attend to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the light they have, for did they but conſider the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, the practice of the ſervants of God, and their own practice in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they cannot but know that a little preparation will not ſerve.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third cauſe, is, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in duties done: did they thinke duties would do them no good without preparation, they would more prepare: but they thinke, if they pray, heare, read, receive the Sacrament with any hearts, theſe duties will helpe their hearts. What is this but to make idols of the ordinances, to make gods of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:40764:154"/> them, to thinke they can helpe our hearts without any further helpe? onely God can helpe the heart without any other helpe, no ordinance can helpe our hearts without the helpe of other ordinances. As the godly are to be reproved for their unpreparednes in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinances, ſo eſpecially in extraordinary, a frequent fault with the godly, and, if ſeene in nothing elſe, yet in the fruitleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſuch duties. It is a ſin to come unprepared unto ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ordinances, but a double ſin to come unprepared unto extraordinary ordinances. It is a taking of Gods name in vain to come unprepared to ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worſhip, but it is a taking of Gods name in vain, in an high degree, to come unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to extraordinary worſhip.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:40764:154"/> Hence God doth often make them to be of contrary effect, ſtraitning, hardning burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, weariſome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To provoke the godly to take heed of unprepared wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God, my doctrine is argument ſufficient. It will weaken the worſhip we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and we cannot ſerve a better maſter, nor do better worke, and therefore no where better beſtow the ſtrength of ſoul and body. I know if thou have the ſpirit of a childe in thee, the ſpirit of reverence, and the ſpirit of love, and thou know aforehand what would helpe or hinder thee in the worſhip of thy heavenly father, thou wilt avoid the one, and uſe the other. But becauſe the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.11. that <hi>the words of the wiſe are as nailes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:40764:155"/> faſtned by the maſters of the aſsem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> and conſequently the more looſe any naile of wiſdome ſticks in the heart of the godly, the more and harder blowes muſt be given, and becauſe it will be confeſſed that this word of wiſdome (preparation for holy duties) hangs looſe in the hearts of the godly, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by force of argument I ſhall endeavour to faſten it: I will uſe a double motive, one from the evil of unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, another from the benefit of preparednes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider the evil of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparednes. 1. It is a tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God. What is it to tempt God, but to move him to go out of his own ordinary way? <hi>Math.</hi> 4.6, 7. when Satan wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our Saviour to caſt himſelf from the pinacle of the temple,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:40764:155"/> upon this ground, that God would give his Angels charge over him, our Saviour anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> Wherein ſhould our Saviour have tempted the Lord by caſting himſelf down? becauſe that was not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way to go down, and therefore not the ordinary way of preſervation, we may gather that from the devils leaving out part of the ſcripture <hi>[in all thy wayes]</hi> without which it would not have ſerved his turne. The like is here, thou comeſt to an ordinance to finde God, to get good to thy ſoul, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared heart, thou now putſt God to go out of his way, or at leaſt tempteſt and trieſt the Lord, whether he will go out of his way or no, for if he meet with thee, and do thy ſoul
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:40764:156"/> good at this time, he muſt go out of his ordinary way, for his ordinary way of meeting the ſoul, is preparation. It is a greivous ſin to tempt God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a preſuming of Gods mercy and goodnes, that he will be good above all he hath revealed, which doth imply a ſecret unthankfullnes for Gods mercy revealed, as if that were not enough; for if it be enough, why ſhould we preſume of more?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a lording it over God, inſtead of ſubjecting our ſelves unto him: when thou prepareſt, thou ſubjecteſt thy ſelf to Gods will; but when thou commeſt for Gods bleſſing in unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rednes, thou deſireſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt that God ſhould let go his own will, and ſtoop to thine: God ſaith, thou ſhalt have

               <p n="3">3. It is a falſifying of Gods truth. God ſaith, he will bow his ear to the prepared heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. We ſay, God will draw near to us, though unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and this we profeſſe when we come unpreparedly to ſeek God: we might as well ſay, God indeed hath ſaid, he will bow his ear to the prepared, but he will not ſtick to his word, he will go from it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The god y complain they cannot meet God in ordinances, they do not affect, move, work upon them: here is the cauſe
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:40764:157"/> we are not prepared, and ſo we are like the deaf adder, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4, 5.) upon whom the charmer cannot prevail, charm he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wiſely, becauſe his ears are ſtopped. A man findes no ſweetnes in his meat, the reaſon is, not becauſe his meat is unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, but becauſe his taſte is diſtempered: the Ordinances are ſometimes ſweet, and would allwaies be ſo, were the ſouls palate allwaies in the ſame tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The godly complain they cannot profit, they get no ſtrength by Ordinances, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are ſtill ſtrong, and grace unready for exerciſe: Let me ask a queſtion, Why doth not meat nouriſh ſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? Becauſe they do not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it. Why do they not digeſt it? Becauſe their ſtomacks
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:40764:157"/> are not prepared, though the meat may pleaſe the appetite well: ſo the heart may be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Word, may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and reſolve upon obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: but ſome ſin in the heart, or ſome immoderate affection may keep off the heart that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo meditate upon the Word, or pray over it, and ſo it comes to no perfection.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If thou come unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and meet God, a great part of thy comfort will be abated before and after; before, thou canſt not have the comfort of thy faith that God will meet thee, becauſe thou art out of the way of the promiſe, thou canſt finde no promiſe to ſuit with thy unpreparednes; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, thy heart will be grieved, Gods comforts are not heat and warmth, comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why then do Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters many times take more care that their people be prepared for the Sacrament, and people take more care to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny not but there may be an opinion rooted in the mindes, both of Miniſters and people, that more preparation is required unto the Sacrament, then unto the Word, which may now be taken away by what hath been ſaid: The cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this opinion may be two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more ſolemn geſture uſed, yea and commanded at the Sacrament, a geſture not onely of reverence, but adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a geſture of worſhip, as the Papiſts themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who profeſſe they kneel, in regard of the reall preſence,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:40764:167"/> and wonder that we deny the reall preſence, and yet kneel. And indeed, if there be no more in the ſupper, then in the word, why do we uſe a geſture in the Sacrament that ſignifieth more? If opinion of greater preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on due to the Sacrament, then to the Word, did not breed kneeling, yet no doubt, kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath bred and nouriſhed this opinion in many.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſeldom, and ſo more ſolemn uſe of this Ordinance, monethly, or quarterly, or yearly, more like an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary then an ordinary Ordinance of God, which might lawfully be uſed every Lords day, hath furthered this opinion, for were it uſed as often as the Word on the Lords day, as it lawfully might, men would not think it of more
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:40764:168"/> weight and conſequence, then the Word preached.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſidering this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſo ſeldom uſed, there may be ſome reaſon rendered of the Miniſters ſpeciall care to prepare the people before the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a preparation of ſeparation, belonging to the Sacrament, which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Word; all may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Word, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. <hi>Go, preach the Goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> no creature is excepted from hearing: ſome think the excommunicate ſhould not be kept from hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the Word, for they are to be but as the Publican and the Heathen, and the Publican and Heathen may hear the Word. But all may not receive the Sacrament, for that is the ſeal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:40764:168"/> and the ſeal doth belong to none but them, who by the Word are brought into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where there is a meeting of more Ordinances, more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is required; but where the Sacrament is adminiſtred together with the Word, is a meeting of more Ordinances, therefore more preparation is required: were this Ordinance more frequently uſed, men would better be acquainted with the preparation due there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Suppoſe a man come to Church on the Lords day, and the Sacrament be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred there, beyond his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether may he receive, not knowing of that aforehand, to prepare himſelf for it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If a man doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:40764:169"/> he may receive lawfully or no, he ſhall do beſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, for in this caſe holds that of the Apoſtle: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin:</hi> if a man do an action, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not whether he ſhall do well or no, he ſinneth in that action, for the rule of our obedience is the Word of God: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not know that ſuch an action is according to the Word, I do not obey in it, and therefore ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thou be prepared for the Word, thou art in meaſure prepared for the Sacrament, for thoſe duties of examination, meditation, praier, which do prepare us for the Word, do not onely ſtirre up thoſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and graces, that are more properly requiſite unto the Word, but thoſe alſo that
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:40764:169"/> more peculiarly belong to the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God may increaſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of thy preparation by the Word, further provoking and ſtirring up thy graces, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thy faith and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there be ſome defect in thy preparation before thou didſt come, yet if thy hearts deſire be ſet to ſeek and finde the Lord, he will have ſuch reſpect to the praiers of the Congregation, that he will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy unpreparednes, and conveigh to thee the bleſſing: ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:40764:170"/> that prepareth his heart to ſeek the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the ſanctuary, and God hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Suppoſe there be a day of faſting kept, and I know not of it till the morning of it, whether may I go unto it, it being an extraordinary duty, and requiring extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and I unprepared, not knowing of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> A day of faſting ought to be kept from even to even, <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.32. therefore to be known before the morning, and they that hinder ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, are like to bear their ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thy ſoul be earneſtly deſirous to ſeek God in that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, unwilling to miſſe the

God requires no more then he gives: had God given thee time of extraordinary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration by fore-knowledge of the duty, he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the ſame; but having not given thee that time, he will not require that. Nay, it may be God will ſpecially prepare thy ſoul by want of ſpeciall preparation, humble and ſoften thy heart.</p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:40764:171"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But the ſcrupulous heart, as the moſt conſcientious are, will be ready to ſay, If God would have had them to partake in the duty, he would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them time of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo, God may give thee the ſubſtance of preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, diſpoſednes of heart, but deny the circumſtances of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, <hi>viz.</hi> time and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of preparing duties. Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſerves unto the worſhip of God, the meaſure and time thereof cannot ſtrictly be ſet down, but the rule thereof, is the meaſure of the ſouls unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parednes. God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded extraordinary prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for extraordinary duties, becauſe the heart uſually is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily unfit: but ſuppoſe by affliction, or ſome other way,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40764:171"/> the heart be more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prepared, then extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preparation is not required, for it is allready done ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; ſo if thy ſoul be much humbled and quickned by want of preparing time and means, it is all one as if thou hadſt them. True it is, God requires preparation, as well as duty, but preparation is the leſſer part of Gods minde, though a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part: when therefore thou maieſt do a greater part of Gods minde, thou art not to neglect it, though thou canſt not do a leſſer, when that not doing of the leſſe, doth not proceed from any known and willing neglect of thine, which alters the caſe. For if a man have time, and do not prepare, he doth preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly, not believingly, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form holy duties. To be ſure,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:40764:172"/> this caſe may put the godly in minde, what need they have to keep their hearts continually in a good frame, that ſo they may have a continuall prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes unto every good work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Suppoſe I labour in the uſe of means to prepare my heart, and cannot finde it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, what ſhould I then do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Thy ſoul may be prepared, and thou not ſenſible of it: it is the meaſure of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and evidence of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the heart, that makes a man ſenſible of his prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Senſe of preparation is a ſeparable fruit of the uſe of the means, part of the ſucceſſe it is, but may be ſeparated from the uſe of the means: when thou therefore haſt prepared thy ſelf,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:40764:172"/> thou haſt done part of thy duty, thou muſt not now ſtay from going about the Ordinances, which is a further part of thy duty, till thou be ſenſible of thy preparednes, which is part of the ſucceſſe, and ſo Gods part: thy duty is to prepare thy heart, and when thou haſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, to go about the worſhip, though God, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his part, the ſenſe and feeling of preparation. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat,</hi> not forbear, when he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined himſelf, becauſe he findes not matters as he would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Suppoſe I finde God helping my heart in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and withdrawing himſelf in the worſhip prepared unto, there my heart is dead, careleſſe, what ſhould I then do?</p>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:40764:173"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The godly are apt in experience to runne upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, if their heart be not aſſiſted, in preparation, they are diſcouraged, if they be much aſſiſted, they grow proud and confident, therefore God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws himſelf ſometimes in one way, and ſometimes in another, that they might not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, nor be confident: Not be diſcouraged, if they do not finde God in one way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, yet they may finde him in another; Not be confident or proud, for though they have found God much in an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet they may miſſe him in the next. Where they leaſt expect to finde God, there many times, they finde him moſt, therefore not be diſcouraged: and on the other ſide, where they are moſt confident to finde
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40764:173"/> God, they many times miſſe him: truſt not Ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but the God of Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Set awork thy faith in the promiſe, the condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou haſt in thy heart: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Thou wilt prepare the heart, thou wilt bow thine ear:</hi> theſe two go together, if God do prepare the heart, he will bow the ear, he will do thee good, thou maieſt believe it, thy preparation is an earneſt, a pledge, thou maieſt thereby help thy faith. Thus did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noahs</hi> wife comfort him, when he was afraid they ſhould die, becauſe they had ſeen an Angel of God: <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.22, 23. If the Lord were pleaſed to kill us, he would not have accepted a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at our hands, nor have ſhewed us ſuch things as theſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40764:174"/> ſo if God had not intended thee good in his worſhip, he would not have accepted thy prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou muſt difference the different effects of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or elſe thou maieſt wrong God as well as thy ſelf, to ſay he was not with thee, when yet he was. Not onely are there more manifeſt and evident fruits of Gods preſence in duties, as much liberty of ſpirit, much joy, peace, aſſurance of faith, but alſo there are more inward, and reſerved fruits of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as ſenſe of want, ſorrow for want, deſire of enjoyment, willingnes unto further duties, to finde that which we want in ſome: in the former, God is with us, and we know he is with us, in the later, God is with us, but we know not ſo
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:40764:174"/> much: an inſtance of the later we have in the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus, Luk.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Their eies were holden that they could not know him,</hi> yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when they did know him, they remembred that they had ſufficient evidence of his preſence, even when they knew him not, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. did not our hearts burne within us, when he talked with us by the way, and opened to us the Scriptures? Whence was that fire in their hearts, but from the ſpirit of Chriſt conveighed in his word? Yet till they knew him, they made no account of this. The godly cannot ſee God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, though preſent: becauſe ſometimes their eies are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether pitched upon thoſe more evident fruits of his preſence, ſometimes alſo they ſtumble
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:40764:175"/> upon the preſence of God, ſleight, make no account of ſuch fruits as are put forth, ſenſe of many failings in duties, makes them think God was not there, whereas that ſenſe is from God in the Ordinances, who is the father of lights.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> Wearines hinders our earneſt worſhipping of God.</p>
               <p>When the worſhip we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme is a burden to us, we do but weakly performe the ſame. This people being weary of the new moon and Sabbath, inſtead of ſetting their hearts upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne worſhip of God therein
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:40764:178"/> performed, they ſet their hearts upon the end of the ſame, they do not ſay, O when will the new moon and Sabbath come? or, O that they would ſtay long; but when will they be gon? no daies ſo long as thoſe daies of ſolemne worſhip, in them the ſunne ſeemes to ſtand ſtill, or to go back, they paſſe not away faſt enough, and if the end of theſe ſolemne ſervices have all the heart, what ſhall God have in the performance of them? This God complains of, both in preiſts and people, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.13. That they had ſaid of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, What a wearines is it? and that worſhip is poorely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which is but a weary worſhip.

When the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13. doth call upon the people of God not to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of well doing, doth he not give them to underſtand, that wearines will be an hinderance to them in well doing? and therefore they muſt not give way unto it, though the way of God be laborious and painfull. When God would direct his people how they might be kept from doing their own minde on the Sabbath, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.13. and ſo might thorowly ſanctifie it,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:40764:179"/> he adviſeth them to call the Sabbath a delight, <hi>i. e.</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inwardly to delight in it, but to grow to ſuch a meaſure of delight, to call it ſo, openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and make it manifeſt that it is our delight, let that be the name we give it, as God termeth his people, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 62.4. my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in her; let others ſee by our ſpeeches and actions, that it is the day of our delight; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe if we be weary of it, and it be a burden unto us, we will not be kept from doing our own pleaſure.</p>
               <p>What is it to be weary of Gods worſhip?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> There is a wearines of the ſoul that reflects upon the body, and a wearines of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that reflects upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p>The wearines of the ſoul ſtands in the abſence of two
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:40764:179"/> affections, which are the ſtrength of the ſoul, deſire, and delight, and the preſence of two, which are the weaknes of the ſoul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnes, no deſire, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, uncheerfulnes, backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, greif. When God in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture commendeth the ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and ſtrength of any action, he commendeth it from theſe two affections, willingnes, and delight.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Willingnes, or deſire, makes any action ſtrongly to be performed, when there is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenes or agreement betwixt the will and the action, a man doth chuſe to do it, and that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any other, ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction muſt needs have the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſoul, for the will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the whole ſoul, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14, 17. the people of God did offer willingly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40764:180"/> abundantly to the building of the temple, that <hi>David</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires and joyes at the offering. The fervent worſhipping of God, propheſied of in the daies of the Goſpel, is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this affection of deſire or willingnes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> in the day of the powerfull preaching of the Goſpel; the worſhip of Gods people ſhould be willing, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted worſhip, not conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Bereans</hi> hearing of the word was hearing indeed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended above that of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, Act.</hi> 17.11. <hi>they received the word with all readineſse of minde,</hi> they had a forward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, a forth-putting deſire to heare, and embrace the word, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> to attend
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40764:180"/> to the word, her ear was open, and ready to hear, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ear came from an open heart, a deſire to heare.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ioy or chearfullnes makes an action ſtrongly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when the ſoul is chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comforted in the doing of it, then will it do it in the beſt manner and meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's comfort and delight is the greater, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5. when the pſalmiſt would expreſſe how ſtrongly the ſun doth run his courſe, he ſaith, It rejoyceth as a ſtrong man to run his race, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. The Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of their joy, and their deep poverty, abounded to the riches of their liberality: though their poverty was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant, and ſo unfit for libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet their joy being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:40764:181"/> in that Chriſtian action, made their liberality to abound, ſo that according to their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yea, and beyond their power they miniſtred to the neceſſity of the Saints, their joy in the action carried them to forget themſelves in meaſure. They prayed <hi>Paul</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, with much intreaty, to take the gift; ſuch was their comfort in the action, that if <hi>Paul</hi> would not take their gift, they ſhould miſſe of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.2. we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſerve the Lord with gladnes, the joy, and mirth of our hearts, in Gods ſervice, doth better the ſervice per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, when deſire and joy are wanting, the ſtrength and vigour of the ſoul is gon, and it is weary of ſuch
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:40764:181"/> actions as it performeth unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and ſadly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What a man doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, backwardly, he doth as a burden, and therefore weakly, becauſe wearily. Thus the wicked expreſſe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of Gods waies, <hi>Job</hi> 21.13. <hi>we deſire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> they have no deſire to be acquainted with the worſhip of God, therefore will but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performe it if they performe any, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2. <hi>feed the flock of God, not by conſtraint, but willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>as every man hath purpoſed, ſo let him give, not grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly or of neceſſity;</hi> whatever dutie a man performeth, if he have no minde, no deſire, no will unto it, if ſomewhat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out move him to it, and not ſomewhat within, if he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not do it, or rather do
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40764:182"/> ſomewhat elſe, he doth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, therefore wearily, it is a burden unto him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.2. God willed <hi>Moſes</hi> to take an offering of every one whoſe heart was willing towards the ſervice of the Tabernacle, <hi>Ex.</hi> 35.21. <hi>They came every one whoſe heart ſtirred him up, and every one whom his ſpirit made willing</hi> to offer, God would accept none but from the willing heart; there would have been no ſtrength in their offerings had the will been wanting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which a man doth ſadly and unchearfully, with inward greif of heart, he doth without ſtrength of his ſoul, and therefore wearily, for ſuch a man doth but bear a burden and carry a load all the while he doth the action, and therefore will not care how ſoon it be

We are alſo commanded to ſerve the Lord with trembling, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. and we know that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling proceeds from the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fear, which is of a ſadding nature. But when our greif is pitched not upon our ſinnes (which are juſt matter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable greif, yea, when we come to joy before God) but upon the duty, we are ſad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we muſt pray, or heare, or keepe the Sabbath, becauſe we muſt fall to that imployment, and may not go to any other, or when ſorrow for other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes become a floud ſo great, that it over-whelmes and drownes
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40764:183"/> our joy, then the duty is a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſome duty, the ſoul doth it with no joy, with no comfort, therefore with no ſtrength. In this caſe when the people wept ſore upon that day of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.10. they are commanded not to weepe, nor to be ſorry, for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength; ſo to weepe, and to be ſorrowfull as to drown or eclipſe their joy on that day, was to make their ſoules weake, and ſo weary of the duty. When <hi>Moſes</hi> chod with <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.17. to the end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had not eaten the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the holy place, that day his ſonnes were deſtroyed, his anſwer was, Had I eaten it, would it have been accepted? Why not? oh he could not have done it with any chear,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40764:183"/> and comfort, ſo heavy a hand of God having lately befallen him, and therefore he ſhould have been weary of the ſervice, and then God would not have accepted it: if thus the heart be weary, having no deſire or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, the body will be weary, for that followes the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoul, the ſoul carrieth the body with it which way ſo ever it goeth.</p>
               <p>There is a wearines proper to the body, when the ſtrength thereof is ſpent and the ſpirits exhauſted, and ſo the body is left weak and feeble, and ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of any further action, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath no ſtrength.</p>
               <p>There is a foure fold cauſe of exhauſting the ſtrength of the body, and ſo making it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods ſervice.</p>

Thus naturally the eyes had rather looke upon a company of ſinners, then a company of Saints, ſee a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the ale-houſe rather then in Gods houſe, propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lords day, then ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, the eare had rather hear evil, then good, the feet had rather walke to any ſinnefull meeting on the Lords day, then to the houſe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19, 20. The Apoſtle ſaith, We natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally give our members, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unrighteouſnes, there is no unwillingnes in us, but we readily part with them all at ſinnes motion, nay, we are free from holines, will have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p n="2">2. The ſtrength of the body is ſpent in ſinnefull actions ſometimes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.3. They wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves to commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Particularly the ſins of uncleannes and drunkennes do waſt the ſtrength of the body, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.11. The holy ghoſt tells what ſhall be the end of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, a mournfull end, thou mourne at the laſt, when thy fleſh, and thy body are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. And doth not experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tell that men are forced to ly in their beds, or keep their houſes, on the Lords day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40764:185"/> they have drunk ſo hard in the week, or on ſaturday, that their bodies are weak and tired. The ſinne of idlenes doth weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the body: ſtrength uſed doth encreaſe, and not uſed doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, beſide the nouriſhment ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for want of exerciſe doth turne to corruption, and ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weaken the body then nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it; none more weary of any imployment and of the ſervice of God, then idle perſons.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The ſtrength of the body is exhauſted, ſometimes by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall diſtempers, ſickneſſes, diſeaſes, either ſuch as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually with men, which is the caſe of ſome, or ſuch as lie upon the body at particular times onely, the caſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Sometimes foregoing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations and buſineſſes of mens
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:40764:185"/> callings, do ſo ſpend the body, that it hath no ſtrength leſt for Gods ſervice.</p>
               <p>The body thus wearied, will reflect upon the ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of ſympathy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, and like affection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſoul and body: what the body delights in, the ſoul doth in meaſure delight in, and what the body is weary of, the ſoul will in meaſure be weary of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it doth expreſſe, and act the wearines of the ſoul by reaſon of ſin, for ſo the weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the ſoul is increaſed, and the contrary ſtrength of the ſoul, deſire and delight, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it is an unfit inſtrument to expreſſe the deſire and delight of the ſoul, if thoſe affections may not be expreſſed, they

               <p n="4">4. As by the eies and ears it doth let in new objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: the ſoul by ſin is new fangled, will entertain them, and ſo grow weary of former delights.</p>
               <p>The ſoul doth expreſſe its wearines.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By letting looſe thoughts and affections, it will not keep them bound, but ſuffers them to wander about for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In thinking the ſervice hard, painfull, grievous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In thinking the time long that is ſpent therein, wiſhing the ſame at an end.</p>
               <p>The body doth expreſſe its wearines.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By reſtleſneſſe, it cannot reſt in any poſition or geſture of it, but as a door upon the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

               <p>How doth wearines weaken our worſhipping of God?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wearines in the very nature of it is weaknes, a deniall, an abſence of ſtrength, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons performed in weaknes, muſt needs be weak: wearines denies the ſtrength of the minde. Can a man think well of what he is

It denies the ſtrength of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: a man will neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, nor joy in what he is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of: and if the ſtrength of the ſoul be denied, the ſtrength of the body alſo will be denied, and that ſervice which hath neither ſtrength of ſoul, nor ſtrength of body, muſt needs be weak ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it is contrary to the ſpirit:</p>
               <p n="1">1.

The ſpirit of a childe, which a ſpirit of love: a childe doth his fathers commands
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:40764:187"/> with deſire and delight, he loves his father, joyes in him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his commands: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. <hi>God loves a cheerfull giver;</hi> wearines being contrary to the ſpirit, muſt needs damp that, hinder the aſſiſtance of it in worſhip.</p>

Is willing and cheerfull ſervice our duty? wearines denies it. If it be our duty to be willing and obedient, why are we weary? Where is our obedience? Is God delighted with cheerfull ſervice? wearines denies it. Who would be weary of that, which is Gods delight? of that which
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40764:190"/> is ſo good, that it joys God himſelf? Is the way of God an eaſy pleaſant way? wearines denies it. Who is weary of eaſe nd pleaſantnes?

               <p n="4">4. To the honour of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: wearines doth caſt reproach and diſhonour upon the ſpirit in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As if it did not diſpoſe and fit them inwardly whom it ſets awork, as if it did not work the will in them, by whom it requires the work to be wrought: for what is the ground of wearines in the perſon, but unfitnes, unſuitablenes unto
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40764:190"/> the work: and is it not a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the ſpirit, to ſet unfit perſons to work? Are we not his workmanſhip unto good works? he doth inwardly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion us thereunto; ſhould a man go to work with an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not firſt fit it with hand and edge? ſhould it not ſhame him? wearines ſaith, that God takes up unhandled, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged inſtruments to do his work; which is a diſhonour to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wearines of good duties doth caſt diſhonour upon the ſpirit, as if his work had wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying properties, and ſo were worſe then Satans work, or our own work, which do not ſo weary. Wearying properties are theſe three; Hardnes, Harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Hurtfullnes. Why doth a work weary, but becauſe it is

               <p n="3">3. Wearines doth weaken our fervent worſhipping of God, as it doth diſpoſe and fit us for the work of ſin and Satan in Gods worſhip, which will weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the worſhip we perform. Wearines doth diſpoſe us for the work of corruption: a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul is fit for wandring thoughts, and wandring affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: a weary body is fit for change of objects, fot new ſights and ſounds, it is naturall to man to ſeek refreſhment elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where when he is weary. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption doth alwaies work in holy duties to hinder us in the
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:40764:192"/> ſame, but when the man is weary, it works with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he is in a corrupt temper, fit for corruption, now it may prevail more then at another time. Wearines fits us for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans work, for his inward ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, for his preſenting of objects to withdraw us; the heart is weary, therefore fit for new work; there is ſmall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to reſiſt him, and he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to and fro, ſeeking whom he may devoure, a great part of his work is to watch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us. When we are at beſt he will hinder us, much more when we are ſo fit to be hindred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Wearines doth weaken our fervent worſhipping of God, as it produceth certain other effects, both in opinion and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:40764:192"/>1. In opinion, it makes a man think the worſhip of God evil, if not in it ſelf, yet to him, at leaſt at this particular time: what a man is weary of, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends to be an evil to him, for no man is weary of good and ſuitable good, for ſuitable good is delightſome, therefore not weariſom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In affection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wearines makes a man deſire the end of the work, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the work: what a man is weary of, he would have finiſhed, that his wearines might be at an end; for whilſt the work continueth, wearines doth continue, and increaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It makes a man deſire to change the preſent ſervice for ſome other imployment, a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man would have new work to take away his wearines, and
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40764:193"/> to bring him contrary comfort and delight. Can that be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſervice, which a man thinks to be evil? the end whereof he more deſireth then the doing of it? which he would change for any other imployment? ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice doth wearines make.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> It may be ſaid you told us lately, what ſome cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are of the wearines of the body in Gods ſervice: tell us now what the cauſes of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of the ſoul are in the ſame ſervice of God?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Remnants of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which do alwaies ſtrive to draw the ſtrength of the minde and affections another way, and ſometimes do prevail by our careleſſenes, and Satans watchfullnes. Thus <hi>David,</hi> when he was acted by corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, having looked too much
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40764:193"/> upon the worlds proſperity, and his own affliction, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon the end of both, he was ready to throw off all the ſervice of God, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.13. <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed mine hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency:</hi> if all the fruit of his piety be affliction, and all the fruit of the worlds prophanenes be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, then hath <hi>David</hi> ſpent a deal of labour in vain, and it is time to make an end: but this was the faulſe ſuggeſtion of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 28.8, 9. When he was mocked and reproached daily for his miniſtery, he ſaid, he would make mention of the Lords name no more, he grew weary of his miniſtery, if he could ſee no better fruit of his labour, but reproach, he would give it over but then he was acted by corruption, as appears
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40764:194"/> by his bitter curſing the day of his birth Thus the godly have ſometimes their ſpirituall ſick ſits, and ſo are ſpiritually weary of ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p>More particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Ignorance of the inward worth and excellency of Gods worſhip and ſervice. So much know; ſo much deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and no more; we cannot deſire and delight in what we know not, for ſo we might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and delight in evil as ſoon, and as much as in good, which cannot be: we do but little know the good of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo can but little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, and where is but little delight, will be weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Imperfect ſuitablenes of ſoul to Gods worſhip: ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and agreement is the cauſe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40764:194"/> of deſire and delight: <hi>Amos</hi> 3.3. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> Can they deſire and delight in one anothers compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, unleſſe they ſuit and agree in diſpoſition? <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.19. <hi>As in water face anſwereth to face, ſo doth the heart of man to man.</hi> Why doth a man love ſome particular man with a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, free, ſtrong love? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>(as in water face anſwereth to face)</hi> a man may ſee the image of his face in water: the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented face hath the likenes of the true face; So a man ſees the image and repreſentation of his own affections and diſpoſitions in ſome more then in others, he ſees himſelf in him, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man loves himſelf more then others, and conſequently ſuch men, in whom he ſees himſelf more then in others: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40764:195"/> The more ſuitablenes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, the more deſire and delight: we are but in a ſmall meaſure ſuitable to the worſhip of God, becauſe the Image of God is but in part renewed in us, and if there be but a meaſure of likenes in us to Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, there will be but a meaſure of delight, and therefore wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines preſent; likenes alone doth exclude wearines: beſide there will be a meaſure of unlikenes, and that naturally cauſeth wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Immoderate deſire and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in other things, even law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full callings, occaſions, and comforts, ſo in my text. Why are they weary of the new Moon and of the Sabbath? the reaſon is rendred, That we may ſell corne, and ſet forth wheat: and why ſhould they ſell corn?
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40764:195"/> that they might gather riches. When they were in the midſt of Gods worſhip, they had a greater deſire and delight to their callings and worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the ſtrength of their ſouls went that way, therefore they were weary of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p n="4">4. So much earthly converſe with our callings and earthly occaſions, I ſay earthly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, after the manner of men, who are altogether earthly, for it is not the uſe of our callings that draw our hearts from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to earth, but the manner of our uſe of them, when we do not ſet awork grace in them, do not uſe them as an appointed way, to fit us for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and therefore watch our hearts, that they be not drawn too much unto the things we
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40764:196"/> have to do with. We do not uſe them with fear, leſt there be a ſnare in them, we do not uſe them with dependance upon God, with ſtrife againſt our naturall earthly mindednes, therefore they ſteal away our hearts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Over-length of duties: there is but a meaſure of deſire, and delight in us, therefore du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould have but a ſet time: in heaven, when our affections ſhall be perfect, there ſhall be no time to meaſure duties by, but they ſhall be immeaſurable. The meaſure of the affections is regulated by judgement and diſcretion, when therefore duties are drawn out beyond diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are burdenſom or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion: beſide, the ſoul hath other occaſions to attend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Gods worſhip, even on the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40764:196"/> Lords day, works of mercy and neceſſity: if therefore time be taken up, ſo that convenient time is not reſerved for theſe, the ſoul growes weary, becauſe it cannot do all its work: ſo in a family, duties are then weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, when they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Abſence of the all-filling and quickning ſpirit. It is the ſpirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing, the words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit and life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. As the body is dead without the ſpirit, ſo the Ordinances without Gods quickning ſpirit, it muſt both quicken our deſire and delight, and ſtirre up the good of the Ordinances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10, 11. <hi>David</hi> exceedingly pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth a door in Gods houſe: why?
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40764:197"/> the Lord is a ſunne: when there is ſuch a preſence of God that is both light and heat to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the good in the Ordinances, and to warm our hearts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, then are they delightfull, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. When the ſpirit ſhews us the face of God, peace, comfort, grace, in the glaſſe of the promiſe, and ſo reflects the ſunne upon us, that whilſt we behold Gods favour, we are at peace with him; whilſt we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his grace, we are made gracious; whilſt we behold his comfort, we are made comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then are the Ordinances delightfull, but if the ſpirit be abſent, there is no affection ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> This Doctrine doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, Firſt, that God hath but weak ſervice at the hands of the moſt, weak praying, weak
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40764:197"/> hearing, becauſe but weary ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But becauſe all will ſay they come willingly and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to Gods worſhip: I will ſhew by ſeverall inſtances, as ſo many arguments, that the moſt are weary of Gods ſervice, ſome whereof will fall upon ſome, and others upon others, and one or other upon the moſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That comming after the beginning of Gods worſhip, and going away before the end of it, which I blamed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, as an act of deſpiſing of Gods worſhip, will prove wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines in this place. Were it matter of delight, Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then the more of it, the more delight, the ſooner men come, the longer they ſtay, the more delight, if men come with the firſt, and ſtay with the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40764:198"/> laſt, they ſhall have more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: but if it be a burden, the leſſe of it, the more delight. Were man to go to a delightfull recreation, they would be there with the firſt, and ſtay with the laſt, upon this ground, leſt they ſhould loſe part of their delight; let not men ſay, they have many hinderances when they ſhould come, and they have many things to haſten them when they ſhould go home, for delight would break thorow hinderances, and make a man forget what would take him off. Do not men forget their meat and ſleep, when they are about pleaſant occaſions? And were the worſhip of God delighfull, men would forget their occaſions at home, till the worſhip of God be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:40764:198"/>2. That allowance of the forenoon only on the Lords day to the worſhip of God, and reſervation of the afternoon, by ſome, which is a clipping of the Kings coin of heaven, for the Sabbath is the Lords day, in a ſpeciall reſpect: all the dayes of the week are Gods, in reſpect of creation, and end, but the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is the Lords, as the Kings coin is his, it bears the Lords image of holines, it is an holy day, ſet apart from common uſe unto Gods worſhip, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the afternoon of that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is to clip the Kings coin, yea though a man ſhould ſpend ſo much time in private reading, as he is wont to ſpend in publike worſhip: ſeeing therefore there is ſuch variety of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſuch convenient time of reſt and refreſhing between
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40764:199"/> the forenoon and afternoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and due and timely fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of the afternoon exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, what but wearines doth keep men from it? Nay, many do take ſo liberally of Gods good creatures on that day (which moſt will have on that day, more then any other, though it be fit for very few bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) that their bodies are made unfit to performe Gods ſervice. Suppoſe the day be cold, or rainy, as it doth ſometimes fall out on that day, and it may be to try whether that will keep men away: would not delight break thorow? will not men do the like for their callings and recreations?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That haſty, hearty and full ſpeech of the world and worldly occaſions on the Lords day, in ſome, when the ſervice
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:40764:199"/> of God is finiſhed morning and evening, as if the Sabbath were a market day, a day of bargen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, paying, receiving, rather then of worſhipping of God or ſeeking the good of the ſouls of men. If the Sabbath be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then nothing muſt be ſpoken or done that day but what is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly holy, or done directly for an holy end, to further Gods worſhip, to helpe our hearts. Were not men weary of holy duties, would they ſo ſoon be gotten to earthly occaſions? would they be ſo hot and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in the ſame? would there not be ſome remembrance of the duties newly paſt, but that men lay aſide a burden when they finiſh them?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The neglect of all private duties by ſome on the Lords day. If they were not tired
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40764:200"/> with, and weary of Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like worſhip, would they not pray in their families? ſpeak ſomething of the word they have heard, though it were the leſſe, the Sabbath being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only for holy duties? But if a man ſhould go from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to family, how few ſhould he finde that pray on the Lords day night, or ſpeak any thing of the word preached, but ſpend the time in idle talking? a ſigne they have enough of Gods ſervice, are tired there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The haſte that ſome make out of the houſe of God into the alehouſe, wherein they can ſit longer then at the worſhip of God. All theſe things which fall upon the moſt, ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, do ſhew what weary ſervice. God hath gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:40764:200"/> performed, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently weak ſervice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The weak ſervice God hath done him by his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for it is weary ſervice, as appeares.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that they are not ſo willing of the approach of the Sabbath, that light is not ſo pleaſant unto them, they think it comes too ſoon, could wiſh it would ſtay a little longer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their hearts are not ſo chearfull in Gods ſervice, nay, many times the Lords day is the ſaddeſt day in the week, they are more merry before it comes, and when it is gone, then in it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They give too much way to wandring thoughts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in holy duties, they are not ſo unpleaſant and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them, they do not ſtrive againſt them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:40764:201"/>4. Secret wiſhings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that the Sabbath were gone, to the end they might go about other occaſions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Too much gladnes of the end of the Sabbath, too much eaſe and reſt in their hearts, theſe things ſhew how weak ſervice God hath, becauſe ſo weary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Their ſin that take courſe to weary ſoul and body, ſo as to make them unfit for Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, for they take courſe to weaken his worſhip: they that overcharge their bodies with ſurfeting and drunkennes, that overtire them with labour, that ſuffer their affections to run at their will upon earthly things, do take courſe that God might have but poore ſervice: to do God but poore ſervice, is a ſin: but to take courſe that God may have but poore ſervice, is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:40764:201"/> ſinnne, that argues we are willing he ſhould have but weak ſervice, or at leaſt are careleſſe of the ſtrength of his worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To reprove 1. Our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall wearines of Gods worſhip. If we conſider it, it may ſhame us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A ſigne we have loſt Gods creation. Is it likely that God would make creatures on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for his ſervice, and make them ſo that it ſhould be a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to them, when it was in his power to make them other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe? Thou art weary of the word, of prayer, canſt reſt no where, doſt continually wiſh the miniſter had done; oh be aſhamed, God did not make thee thus, thou haſt loſt his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, wiped off his ſpot: ſhould a father take paines and be at coſt with a childe, to learn him
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:40764:202"/> the skill of ſome trade, and he ſhould have loſt it when he ſhould come to exerciſe it, would he not be aſhamed? thou haſt loſt the skill of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God, which God gave thee, wherein he was at more paines and coſt, then in making the reſt of his creatures.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:40764:204"/> A notable example ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> was ſtrengthned in his kingdome, <hi>he forſook the law of the Lord, and all Iſrael with him,</hi> they grew weary of the Lords worſhip, whereupon he ſent the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> to take the fenced cities of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and to make towards <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Lord ſends a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to tell them that he had left them in the hands of their enemies, becauſe they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him, this word ſeconding the Lords work did draw them to humiliation, yet the Lord would not wholly deliver them, and he renders the reaſon. verſ. 8. <hi>they ſhall be his ſervants, that they may know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſervice, and the ſervice of the kingdomes of the countries.</hi> They might have ſerved God, and none elſe, but they would

And for heaven they that are naturally weary of Gods ſervice, muſt never looke to come there, unleſſe their natures be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for we pray that we may do Gods will on earth, as they do in heaven, a ſigne all that are in heaven do Gods will chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, for were they weary of it, we might not, we need not pray to do it like them, we might not, it were ſinne, we need not, for we can do it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of our ſelves, a ſigne alſo, that as we looke to come to heaven to be hereafter as they
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:40764:205"/> are already that are in heaven, we muſt do Gods will chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in meaſure upon earth, as they do it in heaven. Though God ſuffer to come into the earth, and to tarry upon the earth, ſuch as worſhip him but wearily, yet he will not ſuffer them to come into heaven: earth is a place of change, in heaven is no change: Nay, heaven would more weary ſuch a man, then he is wearied here, for there is the ſame work for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but more of it, more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, more conſtantly done, and if a little weary men, more will weary them much more. Should I aske you one after another, what you hope will be your condition in another world? you would ſay, you deſire to go to heaven, and you hope to goe to heaven. But your wearines

               <p n="1">1. There is great cauſe we ſhould grow out of love with our ſelves, be weary of our ſelves, if we conſider our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will not, nay cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to do God any good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for they cannot be willing unto it, or cheerfull in it: ſhould I ask any man that believes there is a God, and that God made him, and beſtowed upon him all he hath, he would ſay he were to be worſhipped in the beſt manner: but then come to the heart for a will unto Gods ſervice, and chear in it, and it will not, nay cannot yeild it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnall minde is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40764:211"/> againſt God:</hi> and he proves it by the affection it hath to his will, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, nor indeed can be, it neither doth, nor can come under the command of God, ſubject and ſubmit unto it, that what it requireth ſhall be done willingly and cheerfully. See it in an inſtance, the little fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, religion, that is (I ſay not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt heathens, but) amongſt them that have lived long under the preaching of the Word, and even in this place. Men cannot but be convinced that it is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to read the Word, and to pray in their families, and they cannot but think it is good, ſometimes at leaſt, yet it is not done, they cannot fall to it. How comes that to paſſe? their hearts will not ſuffer them, they have no minde, they have no
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40764:211"/> delight therein; It may be they will ſay they are unable, and that hinders them, but that is but a pretence put upon their unwillingnes, for what a man is willing of, he will get ſome skill in, he will try what he can do; when he hath no skill, he will inquire of others, and by exerciſe gain skill: ſo had men a will to be religious in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, they would get skil, they would firſt pray betwixt God and their own ſouls, they would begge skill of God to pray in their own families, they would get ſome body to pray for them in their families, their wives, if they be able, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or ſervants, or ſome friend, they would firſt learn a praier out of a book, &amp; after pray of themſelves; what is it that will will not do? Have not men

They are willing to do their own works: as here, <hi>When will the New moon be gon, that we may ſell corn?</hi> they have more minde of ſelling corn then of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, they are willing to do ſins work, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.13, 14. evil men do not onely leave the paths of uprightnes, to walk in the waies of darknes, but they rejoice to do evil, and delight in the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes of the wicked. Are theſe not bad hearts that can delight in any thing but what is beſt? More then thus, our hearts do not onely make us unfit to go to heaven, becauſe they make Gods worſhip a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to us, but they make us unwilling to go to Heaven.

In like manner, becauſe unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men cannot be willing of Gods ſervice, the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they cannot be willing of heaven: are not thoſe natures to be loathed that love not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>

And that he was forward unto Gods ſervice, onely for a corrupt end, appears plainly by the teſtimony of the Holy ghoſt concerning him, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. He took no heed to walk in the law of the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with all his heart, he did walk in ſome part of the law, but not with all his heart: the ſervice of God had but a piece of his heart, he was no further willing unto it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in it then ſerved his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ends, that he did not walk in the law of God with all his heart, the ſpirit of God makes it plain, in the later end of the verſe, for he departed not from

                  <hi>Iehu</hi> let them alone, in the ſame policy, for he ſpared them out of the unſoundnes of his heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the matter of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or manner of diſpenſation, doth ſuit with his diſpoſition. An underſtanding judicious man may love preaching that is judicious and underſtanding, fit to increaſe knowledge, and to perfect his underſta ding. A man of meeknes may delight in a Sermon of peace, peace, may be refreſhed with ſmooth, ſoft, milde, quiet preaching. A temperate man may joy in a Sermon that is tart and bitter againſt drunkenneſſe, unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: the liberall man may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſevere preaching againſt covetouſnes: a man muſically affected, may delight in ſinging Pſalms, becauſe theſe things
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40764:215"/> ſuit with their diſpoſitions. The gifts of Miniſters may have an affecting pleaſingnes, they may expreſſe their mindes in ſuch ſit terms, or ſo pathetically, or they may have ſuch a grace in utterance, ſo ready, ſo ſmooth, ſo diſtinct, with ſuch comely carriage of body as may affect, <hi>&amp;c. Ezek.</hi> 33.32. So many, no doubt, may be very forward to Gods Ordinances, ordinary and extraordinary, as a way unto their credit and good name: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we fasted, ſay they, and thou ſeeſt not? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we afflicted our ſouls, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> they thought they deſerved to be regarded highly for their faſting, even of God himſelf, and expoſtulate with God for diſregarding them, a ſigne they made account of that, and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:40764:216"/> chiefly at that in doing the duty, otherwiſe they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have complained of the ſins found in thoſe duties, a God doth: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaking of hypocrites, ſaith, <hi>they love to pray ſtanding in the Synagogues, and in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the ſtreets:</hi> they doe not onely pray in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the ſtreets, but they love to pray there, they have an affection thereto, a delight therein; why? not in regard of the duties themſelves, or Gods glory, but their own ends, that they may be ſeen of men, get praiſe and glory to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Unregenerate men may have ſome affection to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the ſervice of God, by reaſon of ſome work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon them for the time. As</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:40764:216"/>1. A work of illumination, giving ſome clear diſcerning of that good is in Gods worſhip, more then in any other imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the apprehenſion of ſuch good, whileſt it laſteth, will ſomewhat ſtirre the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Awaking and exciting the conſcience to do its office, which by promiſes of good, on the one hand, and threatnings of evil, on the other, aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God, hath a power to command the deſire and delight of the ſoul to work. <hi>Felix</hi> his conſcience awaked by the preaching of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſtirred his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of fear. And when the conſcience doth charge it upon the affections, as a duty to joy in Gods worſhip, and to be willing unto it, a duty which God will reward, the contrary
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40764:217"/> whereto God will puniſh, it may forcibly compell, and draw out the affections.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lifting up the affections of deſire and delight, by an heavenly power of experience. As a man which dips his finger in ſome ſweet liquour, and taſteth the ſweetnes of it, doth afterward deſire and delight therein; So God doth by the work of his ſpirit, ſometimes drench the affections of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men in the ſweetnes of his worſhip, doth ſo make their affections, and the good of the Ordinances to meet, that they feel and taſte a ſweetnes, which make them affected afterward to the means thereof: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. Such as afterward fall away, may taſte of the powers of the world to come, may dip their finger in the rivers of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:40764:217"/> of Heaven. But this work of the ſpirit, making unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men willing to, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the worſhip of God, is rather a work upon them, then in them, a forced work, not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, rather a flaſh, then a fire of affection. The affections are lifted up, not altered and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, acted onely by an outward principle, the work of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the experience the ſpirit hath forcibly and powerfully wrought, not by an outward and inward principle, both the ſpirit of God, and the ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of the affection to that which is good, as in the godly. If this were well conſidered, that mens natures have no affection to that which is good, it would keep them from priding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their knowledge, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, wit, gifts, it would keep
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:40764:218"/> them from pride in beauty, and trimming their bodies, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring there is no part of the body but gives it ſelf away to ſin, and is wholly unwilling to beſtow it ſelf in the ſervice of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As there is great cauſe that unregenerate men ſhould grow out of love with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, on the one hand, ſo in love with the image of God, on the other hand, that, and that onely can affect their hearts with Gods worſhip, for Gods Image is that in the heart, which the law of God is in the book of God: <hi>Act.</hi> 13.22. I have found a man after my own heart, ſaith God of <hi>David,</hi> which ſhall ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all my will. <hi>David</hi> was therefore fit to fulfill all Gods will, becauſe his heart was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Gods own heart: and what this is to be after Gods own
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:40764:218"/> heart, we ſhall know, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>David</hi> expreſſing his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to do the will of God in other terms: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy will, oh my God, yea, thy law is within my heart: David</hi> therefore delighted to do Gods will outwardly, becauſe he had the law of God within in his heart. Who would not have an heart like Gods heart, an heart adorned with the good law of God? Till thou have this heart, thou canſt not from within taſte ſweetnes in, and readily come unto the worſhip of God. Oh therefore thou that findeſt thy ſelf in an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate condition, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God a burden to thee, go to God, tell him that indeed it was his goodnes to make thee after his image in <hi>Adam,</hi> when thou couldeſt willingly and
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:40764:219"/> cheerfully have ſerved him, but it was thy ſin in <hi>Adam,</hi> to make away that image which now thou perceiveſt the want of, tell him, he hath promiſed to wri e his law in the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a ſecond time, pray him to make good that promiſe to thee, thou canſt not elſe ſerve him with thy heart; as the good will be thine, ſo the glory will eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Having thus ſpoken to the unregenerate, to perſwade them to grow out of love with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and in love with the Image of God, as the way to grow in love with Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſo to remedy their wearines; let me now turn my ſpeech to the people of God, who are ſenſible of wearines, bear it as a burden, and would gladly be rid of it, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:40764:219"/> this ground, which they are well aware of, becauſe it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them in Gods worſhip. Let me firſt exhort, and then direct them to get rid of this wearines in a greater meaſure. Firſt let me exhort them, and for that end I will uſe a double argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſhall be my Doctrine, Wearineſſe makes us perform weak ſervice unto God, which every childe of God hath great reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The weight of this firſt argument will appear, if we conſider Time

               <p n="1">1. God hath put into us a principle of willingnes and cheerfullnes in his ſervice, a new nature, which wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſtirring up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving, and we ſhould be more affectionate and lively in Gods ſervice; this appeares in that the Apoſtle calls upon <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. to ſtirre up the gift of God, there was an holy fire of grace in him, which did but need ſtirring up, were the aſhes but blown from it, it
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:40764:223"/> would flame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1.

That the godly are no more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full therefore in Gods ſervice, is careleſſenes, want of taking paines: and doth not that make our ſinne much greater?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We do expect that God
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:40764:223"/> ſhould willingly and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet us, and do us good in his ordinances, if we want counſell, comfort, grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, ſafety. The godly have not onely prayed to God in caſe of their neceſſity, but they have added their deſire, that God would not keepe ſilence, but when they have ſpoken to him in prayer, that he would ſpeake again to them by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, word, and providence; when they have ſpoken their troubles, that he would ſpeake comfort; when they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their doubts, that he would ſpeake counſell; when they have ſpoken their wants of grace, that he would ſpeake ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. When God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf from his people, though ſeeking him in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, they have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly

It is the frame of the heart of the
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:40764:225"/> godly thus to deſire God cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to meet with them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, God muſt come off with every mercy cheerfully, and give us his love, more then the mercy; and ſhall we come off heavily with the ſervices we perform to him? What equity is in this, God muſt do our mindes and deſires cheerfully, and we his minde, wearily? do we more deſire and value the Lords love then his mercies, and will not the Lord looke more at our love then the duties we perform? It argues too much ſelf love, too little love to God, to deſire all may come from God to us heartily, but to let all go from us to God grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>

<pb n="429" facs="tcp:40764:226"/> it be done for by ends, yet God will recompenſe it with tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſavours. <hi>Iehu</hi> executed all the will of God upon <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, his intent was not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God, but to gain glory to himſelf for preſent, and to make the kingdome ſure to him for after time, yet becauſe he did it heartily, God promiſed his children ſhould ſit upon the throne to the fourth generation, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> did accompliſh Gods whole work upon <hi>Tyrus;</hi> his intent was to ſerve himſelf of them, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did it willingly and cheerfully, though he did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo great loſſe, therefore God did recompenſe him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.18, 19. And ſurely ſhould not the godly be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their weary ſerving of God, he would not reward
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:40764:227"/> their ſervice in heaven. And ſo much as the godly give way to backward and uncheerfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſo much they do blur and blot their evidence of heaven, for God doth not reward our praying, hearing, almes, but our willing and cheerfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the ſame, for we do no more any work then we do it willingly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God will reward us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our work, meaſure for meaſure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>He that ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he that ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully,</hi> and what the meaſure of their bounty muſt be, we may ſee in the next verſe, <hi>as every man hath purpoſed in his heart, ſo let him give, not grudgingly, or of neceſſity,</hi> ſo much willingnes and heartines, ſo much bounty; and ſo much
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:40764:227"/> as men give conſtrainedly, and grudgingly, ſo much ſparing and covetouſnes. We may therefore increaſe, or diminiſh, make more, or make leſſe our reward in heaven, by our cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or uncheerfull ſerving of God, for God will reward us according to our works, and that not ſo much according to the work of our body and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, as according to the work of our will. That this is ſo, appears hence.</p>
               <p n="1">1 The will that is ſet awork in any action, is the worke of the more noble part, the ſoul, and therefore is the more noble work, the better work, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Gods work more, and glorifying him more; ſurely God will moſt recompenſe the beſt work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So much of the will in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:40764:228"/> action, ſo much and no more we alone do the action, without help of others, ſo much as we do it willingly, we do it from within, moved thereunto by our ſelves; but ſo much as we do it unwillingly, ſo much we do it from ſomething without us, and the more we do an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone, the more will our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be; if others joyn with us, and by ends ſet us on, part of our reward is due to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When any duty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the work of the body is but ſingle, but the work of the will is double, for beſide it own act of willingnes unto the duty, it doth ſet awork the body, the body only doth the work, it doth not ſet awork the ſoul; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in it's working it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the willingnes of the ſoul, but cannot begin the duty, lead
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:40764:228"/> the ſoul, ſet awork the ſoul, it may occaſion the working of the will, but hath no command or power over the will, but the will doth ſet on the body, and where the moſt work is done, there the moſt wages is due.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Should God reward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the outward work, rather then according to the will, then were it not poſſible for poor men to have ſo much glory in heaven as rich men, nor women as men, becauſe they have not ſo much opportunity, to ſerve God, in regard of the outward work. Nor ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, that do but little good in their places, poſſibly have ſo much reward, as they that do much good, no though their will were better, which would contrary that of our Saviour concerning the widow, and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:40764:229"/> the rich men, caſting in their gifts into the treaſury, this wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow hath caſt in more then they all, not more in quantity in the outward work, but more in the will: if therefore the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work of the poor be leſſe then that of the rich, yet if the will be more, the work is more, and ſo the recompence ſhall be more.</p>
               <p>The ſecond argument to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the godly to remedy this wearines, is drawn from conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the evil of wearines, and the benefit of delight in Gods ſervice. The evil of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines we may finde in the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where my text is, the evil threatned to the ſinnes of that chapter whereof this is one: ſee this evil laid down in three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Change of joy into ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:40764:229"/> yea the greateſt joy into ſorrow, verſ. 3. what greater joy then the joy of the Temple, under the old Teſtament, when there was ſuch variety of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſick, which, being commanded by God, were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to increaſe the joy of his people? to have theſe ſongs ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is a ſadnes, but to have them turned into howlings, makes much more ſorrow, verſ. 10. To have the ordinary dayes of Gods people turned into mourning, and their ordinary mirth into lamentation is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, but to have their ſeaſt-dayes, dayes of greateſt mirth turned into mourning, and their ſongs, the greateſt expreſſions of joy, into lamentation, is much more heavy, yet God will change the greateſt joy of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worſhippers into greateſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:40764:230"/> as he ſaith, verſ. 10. <hi>I will make it as the mourning of an one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon, and the end thereof as a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter day,</hi> it ſhall be a mourning with a witnes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This change of greateſt joy for greateſt ſorrow, ſhall be ſudden and unexpected. The benefit of expectation of evil is this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A man may poſſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent evil expected.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or at leaſt he may labour to prepare for it, and ſo the evil will be mitigated, but ſudden and unexpected evil hath this aggravation, a man can neither prevent it, nor is prepared to bear it, ſo it ſhall be here, verſ. 9. <hi>I will make the ſunne to go down at noon, and darken the earth in the clear day:</hi> for the ſunne to go down at night is no ſtrange thing, but to go down at noon,
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:40764:230"/> who expects that? to have the earth darkned in a clear day, vvho doth look for it? ſo here, vvhen their ſunne ſhall be at the height, their joy at the greateſt, vvhen their day ſhall be moſt clear, and likely ſo to continue, yet then their ſunne ſhall ſet, and their day darken, their joy ſhall turne into ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The kinde of evil that ſhall cauſe this ſorrow ſhall ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it: vvere it ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affliction, that, in it, the ſoul might be ſafe, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, it vvere leſſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but it ſhall be ſuch an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, vvherein the ſoul ſhall neither be comfortable nor ſafe, a famine of hearing the vvords of the Lord, a ſcarcity of that vvorſhip, they have been vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of, which evil is many wayes aggravated.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:40764:231"/>1. By compariſon, not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of bread, though the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of the body be grievous, as experience doth prove, yet this ſhall be greater, that ſhall be nothing to this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God did take away ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall hunger together vvith food, it vvere ſomething, but they ſhall hunger and thirſt, be pinched and pained ſpiritually, finde, it may be, more emptines and inward gnawings of ſpirit, then when they had the meanes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Might they with little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe, doe, and ſome ſmall paines be ſupplyed, it were leſſe matter, but they ſhall take weary paines, wander from ſea to ſea, runn to and fro: they were weary of going to a ſet place of Gods worſhip, but now they ſhall wander to and fro, go to ſeek it they know not whither, places
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:40764:231"/> unlikely as well as likely, they were weary of going to Gods worſhip, though had with eaſe, but now they ſhall runne to and fro, weary themſelves with taking paines.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Might they finde what they ſeek with paines taking, they ſhould finde reſt after paines t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>king, but they ſhall not finde it, after their paines taking, they ſhall ſtill be to ſeek, which makes the evil more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, becauſe remediles. Let the godly feare and tremble leſt their wearines of Gods worſhip bring this evil, the change of greateſt joy into greateſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and that when we leaſt exp ct it, and which is moſt of all, by the irrecoverable loſſe of that worſhip of God we have been weary of.</p>
               <p>Touching the benefit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:40764:232"/> in Gods worſhip, on the contrary, the 112. <hi>Pſal.</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, where the man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his commandements is pronounced a happy man. And becauſe outward bleſſings do carry the greateſt ſhew of happines to the eyes of men, therefore the holy ghoſt doth eſpecially inſiſt upon them, they may be ranked to three heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Injoyment of outward good things, children, riches, honour, 2. 3, 9. He ſhall not have theſe mercies barely and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as others, but with a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold addition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inward diſpoſitions of graciouſneſſe, mercy, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, diſcretion to improve well his riches, giving unto ſome, lending unto others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Eſtabliſhment and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:40764:232"/> of eſtate, verſ. 3.9. <hi>his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe endureth for ever,</hi> he ſhall have ability to give and lend, not for a time only, but for ever, his outward condition ſhall not be a flouriſh onely, but a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Succeſſion of theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to his ſeed and poſterity, verſ. 2. his children ſhall come into his place and mercies, be heires of his bleſſings, that a man may ſee and ſay his ſeed is bleſſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Change of darkenes into light, verſ. 4. He may be in darkenes, in affliction, but that ſhall not alwayes continue, light ſhall ariſe, and as vvhen the morning is at the darkeſt, the light breaks out, ſo vvhen they and others think the night vvill alwayes continue, they ſhall periſh in darknes, then ſhall light
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:40764:233"/> break out, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.10. as chear hath ariſen in his heart in the difficulties of Gods ſervice, ſo light ſhall ariſe in the darkneſſe of his condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eſtabliſhment of heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſeares of evil, verſ. 6, 7, 8. tidings of evil may come to his eare, but his heart ſhall be arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt them, to keep it's preſent temper, it ſhall be fixed, eſtabliſhed, he ſhall be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of Gods preſervation, in whoſe ſervice he hath delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ſhall rather ſee his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire upon his enemies, then they their deſire upon him. His good ſhall be ſo great every way, that it ſhall be matter of great envy, even to the conſuming of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Having thus exhorted the godly, now unto direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How may we remedy
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:40764:233"/> the wearineſſe of the ſoul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Two things are this way uſefull.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Generally, labour to be more ſuitable to Gods worſhip, get increaſe of grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.15. <hi>It is joy to the juſt to do judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> judgment is ſuitable to that inward juſtice is in him, therefore a joy unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I delight in the law of God after the inward man,</hi> ſo much grace, ſo much delight in Gods worſhip, were we more holy, ſpirituall, heavenly, as the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, we ſhould be more affected to it.</p>
               <p>More particularly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Labour to increaſe love to God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God that we keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> and his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not greivous: love to God makes the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:40764:234"/> of God good, pleaſant, eaſie, love takes away the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of an action, and makes it delightfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Labour the increaſe of perfection of heart, theſe two go together 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. <hi>ſerve him with a perfect heart and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde,</hi> the more perfect the heart is, in regard of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the more willing. Why is the heart unwilling, but becauſe parted and divided, ſet too much upon other things? 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.15. they rejoyced at the oath, becauſe they had ſworn with all their heart, and ſought him with their whole deſire, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour the increaſe of uprightnes of heart, theſe two go together, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.17. when we deſire and delight in the worſhip of God, for by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:40764:234"/> or affections will vary, be more or leſſe, according to thoſe reſpects, but when we deſire and delight in the worſhip of God for right ends, the purity thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140. Gods command, Gods glory, theſe will ever continue the ſame to draw our affections.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Frequently exerciſe Gods worſhip, communion doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe affection, hereby we ſhall ſee more the good of Gods worſhip, and feel the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it. Vſe will take away dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, which doth hinder af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: what men diſuſe they are unwilling to, they will ſay it is out of their fingers: ſo if we neglect Gods worſhip it will grow out of our hearts. The more we worſhip God in ſecret, the fitter ſhall we be for fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip, and the more we
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:40764:235"/> worſhip God in our families, the ſitter we ſhall be for publike worſhip?</p>
               <p>

               <p>

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40764:235"/> looſe that it will not be fixed in any ordinance.</p>
               <p>Caution. Let the godly be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed not too eaſily to hearken to the complaints of the body, <hi>i. q.</hi> the ſoul may deceive us, thereby we may rather ſuſpect the complaints of the body in Gods worſhip, and truſt them elſe where, for the ſoul is more apt to be weary in Gods worſhip, and leſſe weary in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works, and the body is more apt to be weary in other works, and leſſe in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the ſoul is more weary of Gods worſhip; becauſe it hath leſſe diſpoſednes thereto, and it is more ſpirituall, and ſo lieth heavier upon the ſoul, it is leſſe weary of other works, becauſe it hath more diſpoſednes unto them, and they are more bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and do not ſo lye upon the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:40764:236"/> ſpirit, the body is more weary of other worke, becauſe they take more of the body, leſſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods worſhip, becauſe it is more ſpirituall, and doth not ſo preſſe upon the body: ſuſpect therefore the complaints of the body in Gods worſhip, and do not eaſily hearken unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is time and place for the execution of an holy revenge upon the body. It hath ſpent the whole day, and it may be the night after that, in ſin, therefore put it to, make it do ſomewhat more for the ſervice of God, then it willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would. This is not cruelty, but mercy to our bodies, to conſtrain them to Gods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. There is a neceſſity of beating down the body, if we
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40764:236"/> mean it ſhould be helpfull to our ſouls, if we too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them, we do againſt our ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>ult.</hi> There is a danger, that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf may be caſt away, whilſt he doth preach to ſave others, if he do not beat down his body. The occaſions and comforts we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converſe with, do give a ſtrength to the body, and the body gives a ſtrength to ſin. Hence the fruit of the godly is more mellow and gracious in old age, becauſe the vigour of their bodies decaying, the ſtrength of ſin is waſted.</p>

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:40764:238"/> the reſt, as we may conceive, becauſe they had expreſſed moſt forward confident affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he will try them, that upon triall they might better know themſelves and be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>Peter, ver.</hi> 33, 34, 35. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he will not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended becauſe of the evil ſhall befall Chriſt, though all be offended. And when Chriſt tells him that he ſhall deny him thrice that night, he believes himſelf rather then Chriſt, and affirmeth that he will ſooner die with him then deny him. The two ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee, Matth.</hi> 20.20, 21, 22. <hi>deſire to ſit the one at Chriſts right hand, and the other at his left in his Kingdom,</hi> he asketh them whether they be able to drink of his cup, and to be baptized with his baptiſme: they ſay they are able, as little
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40764:239"/> conſidering what they now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, as what they before asked, when our Saviour had parted theſe three from the reſt, he began to be ſorrowfull, and very heavy, he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth his ſorrow to them, and the extremity thereof, My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death, he had as much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row as life could hold, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them, to whom he had thus ſpecially unboſomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they would tarry in that place, and watch with him. As he was ſenſible of affliction, ſo of comfort, and the means thereof. It became him to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all righteouſnes, therefore not onely to pray himſelf, but to reſort to the praiers of others. His ſuſpended comfort, muſt be recovered in Gods own way. The weak Diſciples may help
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:40764:239"/> their perſect Saviour, whileſt he ſuffered as a ſinner, if they doe but watch. But watching was not all that Chriſt aimed at, that is a duty no further uſefull, then it ſeemeth for ſome other end: Chriſt would have them watch, that they might pray with him, as <hi>ver.</hi> 41. Watch and pray, watching without praier had been but a waking idlenes. Our Saviour himſelf goes a little further from them and praies earneſtly, that if it vvere poſſible the cup of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings might be turned ſome other vvay; He returneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his Diſciples, and findeth them aſleep. Though they had profeſſed great love to him, and great ability to expreſſe that love, though he ſingled them out, and told them his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent great neceſſity, and cald
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:40764:240"/> upon them to watch and pray, <hi>i. e.</hi> to pray, not drouſily, but fervently, which in all theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards did preſſe upon them as duty, yet they fell aſleep, and were thereby hindred. Whence I note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> Sleep is an hinderance to commanded fervency in Gods worſhip. Sleep in time of Gods worſhip, is an enemy to ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy therein. It was the duty of the Diſciples in this place, to watch and pray, <hi>i. e.</hi> to pray fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently, to pray with the uſe of all helps unto the ſame. Chriſt gave them command ſo to do, he ſtood in need of their help, as an Ordinance of God, his command was to watch with him, and his reproof, that they did not watch with him, but they were hindred by ſleep, they did not pray at all, that we
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:40764:240"/> read of, if they did, yet not ſo fervently and diligently as there was cauſe: for then our Saviour would not have reproved them. I remember but one onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this caſe in the book of God, a young man that fell a ſleep at a Sermon in the night, and in his ſleep fell down from a third loft, and was taken up dead, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.9. A paſſage in the Acts of the Apoſtles, which God would have recorded, to be a warning to all Sermon-ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:40764:241"/> body is not allwaies ready, when the ſoul is willing to do good. The ſpouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2. doth acknowledge that ſhe did ſleep, when her heart did wake, ſhe had good affections inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which yet wanted outward expreſſions: So here there was a waking heart in theſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, a will to watch with Chriſt, but the body was vveak and infirm.

The body knows its time, is ſpent in the occaſions of the day, cannot well vvork day and night both, therefore it falls aſleep, when it ſhould watch and pray at ſuch time; the caſe of theſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>

               <p>That this vvas ſo, appears,</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>This was a ſit means to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble theſe ſelf-confident Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: not to exerciſe grace in ordinary courſe, is matter of humiliation; but not to exerciſe grace, when we have moſt need to exerciſe the ſame, in the worſhip of God, for our own good and the good of others, is matter of greater humiliation.

<pb n="466" facs="tcp:40764:245"/> attention unto duties, and pains-taking in the ſame, doth chear, and awaken both ſoul and body.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A preſent ſenſeleſneſſe of the neceſſity of watching, both to attain good and prevent evil. A ſleepy conſcience makes a ſleepy body: when that doth not its office, as a monitour to warn and preſſe unto duty, the conſcience is made thus ſleepy and ſo ſenſeleſſe of good to be found, or evil to be prevented by watchfull performance of duties, two waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ſome falſe opinion, and errour of minde, ſome falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of things, ſome falſe concluſion drawn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from ſome truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the conſcience is deceived, and ſo caſt aſleep: <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.5. <hi>Whilst the bridegroom tarried, the
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:40764:245"/> Virgins ſlumbred and ſlept:</hi> from this falſe opinion, that it was no matter if they ſlept in time of the bridegrooms tarrying, and no good was to be gotten by waking and watching, unleſſe the bridegroom had been at hand, which was falſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that of our Saviour: <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.35, 36, 37. <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning, And ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord, when he will return from the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that when he commeth and knocketh, they may open to him immediatly. Bleſsed are thoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, whom the Lord, when he commeth, ſhall finde watching: Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them to ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them.</hi> Something is to be done, when the Lord delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:40764:246"/> his comming unto us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, and our expectation, we are then to wait for him, and it is not in vain ſo to do, for by that means we ſhall be ready to entertain him ſpeedily when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, and ſhall receive more honourable acknowledgement from him. So <hi>ver.</hi> 45. <hi>If that ſervant ſhall ſay in his heart, My Lord delaieth his comming, and ſhall begin to beat the men-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken.</hi> Why doth the evil ſervant miſcarry himſelf thus, in the delay of his Maſters comming, but from a falſe opinion, that there was no danger in his misbehaviours, unleſſe his Maſter were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and at hand, contrary to what our Saviour addeth: <hi>v.</hi> 46. <hi>The Lord of that ſervant will come
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40764:246"/> in a day, when he looketh not for him, and in an houre when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</hi> Though God come not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto misbehaving men, yet that will not take away their danger, he will come ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and too ſoon for them, and bring recompence enough, though he delay, and that they may reſolve upon, as ſure and certain.</p>
               <p>In like manner, had men true and preſent apprehenſions of the benefit of watching in time of Gods worſhip, and the danger of ſleeping, they would leave ſleeping, and fal to waking; but they are deceived by a falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that there is no good to begotten by waking, nor evil to be found in ſleeping, and ſo
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:40764:247"/> they are ſenſeleſſe, not at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the good of the one, or evil of the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The conſcience is made ſleep, and ſo ſenſeleſſe of good to be obtained, or evil to be prevented, by waking in the time when God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, by ſome ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not repented of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by grace is dulled, and the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king quickning ſpirit of God grieved and withdrawn. This was <hi>Ionahs</hi> caſe, when he had fled from Gods work, againſt his knowledge and conſcience, the grace of God was ſo dulled, and his conſcience made ſo ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, that whereas he ſhould have ſpent his time in confeſſing his ſin, and humbling his ſoul, and ſeeking peace with God, he ſettles himſelf to ſleep: <hi>Ionah</hi> 1.5. yea in time of the ſtorm,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:40764:247"/> when the naturall conſciences of the heathen, did call upon them to pray, and would not let them reſt, <hi>Ionahs</hi> conſcience was ſo ſleepy, that it ſuffered him to continue his ſleep, which had it been waking and reſtleſſe, it would not have done; Not <hi>Ionahs</hi> conſcience, but the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter doth awaken him, and that with upbraiding his ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. What meaneſt thou, ô ſleeper? ariſe, call upon thy God. Thus the conſcience of a godly man after ſin commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be more ſleepy an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more hardly awaked, then the conſcience of a naturall man. <hi>Ionah</hi> having ſinned, his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was ſleepy, and he not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the good of waking and praying, and returning into the way out of the which he was gon, nor of the danger of ſleeping
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:40764:248"/> in ſin, the way to pull down the awaking judgements of God, as it fell out; So when men, even good men, come to the houſe of God in their ſpeciall ſins unrepented of, they come with ſleepy conſciences, not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the good found in watchfull attendance upon the Ordinances, nor of the danger of drouſines and ſleepineſſe, and a ſleepy ſoul makes a ſleepy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yea they ſleep faſt whom ſin rocks aſleep.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third cauſe of ſleep in time of Gods worſhip, is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, when the ſpirit and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is tired, and ſo made fitter to reſt then to labour. This wearines that brings on ſleep, comes,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From toiling and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working the body in other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: <hi>Iudges</hi> 4.21. <hi>Siſera</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:40764:248"/> weary, falls faſt aſleep, to the loſſe of his life. When men come to family duties with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verwearied bodies, or to the houſe of God, having overtoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their bodies in the week, or allowing themſelves too little ſleep on the Saturday night, they are fitter to ſleep, then to perform duties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This wearines that fits the body for ſleep, doth alſo come from the length of good duties, we are imperfect creatures, and can endure but a meaſure in the beſt actions, though they be moſt comfortable: <hi>Act.</hi> 20.9. The ſpirit of God ſpeaking of <hi>Eutychus</hi> ſleeping at the Word, doth adde, that <hi>Paul</hi> was long in preaching, thereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that it was ſome cauſe of his ſleep, through the weaknes of nature.</p>

Neceſſity and ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion will make ſleep depart from our eies. <hi>Iacobs</hi> care of his
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40764:249"/> ſheep and feare of their danger kept him from ſleeping in the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.40. The ſame man afraid of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> whom he was to meet the next day, ſpent the night in prayers and teares, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. <hi>there wreſtled with him a man till the breaking of the day, Luk.</hi> 6.12, 13. our Saviour ſpent the whole night in prayer, when he was to chuſe his apoſtles the next day. And in the place where our text is, when he was preſently to be betrayed by <hi>Iudas,</hi> and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the ſouldiers, he prayed, and prayed again, and had no ſleep in his eies, though his diſciples were ſo ſleepy that they could not hold open their eies. When <hi>Paul</hi> was to depart on the morrow, and the diſciples to ſee his face no more, he continued his ſpeech untill
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:40764:250"/> midnight without any drouſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. If we will ſpend the night in holy duties, there muſt be ſomething beſide the bare du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to keep us awake, ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waking neceſſity or ſpeciall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, it will not be ſufficient that we are loth to ſpend the day, there muſt be ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which will ſo ſtirre the the affection, that it will ſtirre and diſeaſe the body. Nor, is it good to put off family duties till late at night, unleſſe we think God will be ſerved with ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtead of praying. Theſe inſtrumentall cauſes I have been ſpeaking of, are over ruled by the principall cauſe, God, to puniſh ſuch ſinnes as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Idleneſſe in our particular callings. Is it not juſt with God, that they who are drouſie in the occaſions that concern their

               <p n="2">2. Overmuch labour in their callings. Is it not juſt with God, that they who ſpend too much paines upon their own callings, ſhould ſpend too little upon his ſervice? too much upon their bodies, and too little upon their ſoules?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Heartleſſe worſhip of God, when men bring God a body only, and take no care to bring the ſoul, it is juſt with God they ſhould not give ſo much as a body, but rather ſleep.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pride in ſpirituall abilities. Is it not juſt with God, that they who are conceited of ſtrength, ſhould expreſſe weakneſſe, as they do that ſleep? and ſhall we think the Devil hath his hand

He helps men to over-weary themſelves, in the week, whereby they are unfit for the Sabbath.

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40764:251"/> themſelves eaſily, to hang down their heads and ſhut their eies, as furtherances. He can if God permit caſt an heavineſſe upon a man.

<pb n="480" facs="tcp:40764:252"/> he cannot worſhip God at all. For though the ſoul be able to worſhip God without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as appeares by the working of the phanſie in ſleep, and the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body in heaven, yet in thoſe duties, wherein the ſoul muſt be helped by the body, as in all outward worſhip with others, it cannot worſhip God if the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be aſleep, for herein the ſoul is directed by the eye, and by the eare, what part of worſhip to ſet about, when to begin and when to make an end, what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decorum to keep; for in publike duties, we are ſo to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, as not only God may be glorified by us, and we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in our ſoules, but alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may be edified in their worſhipping of God, which they cannot be by the works of

               <p>If our ſleep be not faſt, but rather a ſlumbring, a drouſines and heavines, our ſervice of God is marred, for our bodies are unto our ſoules in this caſe as an hollow trunk ſtopped in the midſt, our eyes do but half ſee, and our eares but half heare, the ſight dies in the eye, and ſound in the eare, they come not to the ſoul, there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct underſtanding of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in hand, much leſſe any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection moved, but a man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of hearing, praying, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is like unto that man in a dream ſpoken of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.8.

               <p n="1">1. To be thankfull unto God, it is a mercy, and a mercy deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto many others. Hereby we are kept from ſinne and from much ſorrow of heart, which befalls others of the godly, hereby we have that advantage to worſhip God, and get good to our ſoules, that others want.

If <hi>Peter</hi> had watched and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he had not ſo denied his maſter, nor the diſciples had fled, and left their maſter, for our Saviour bad them watch and pray, that they might not enter into temptation: had they watched and prayd they had not been ſo overcome of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: who knows what the young man might have gotten for his ſoul by <hi>Pauls</hi> laſt Sermon, had he not ſlept?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Improve your waking and watching in holy duties, let not your ſoules be like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the more waking the more unſetled, whom therefore we wiſh aſleep rather then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake: ſo the more waking our

Make we uſe therefore of our waking, by binding our ſoules cloſe to Gods worſhip, by the attention of our eyes and eares, and that for a double reaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some will alwaies be drouſie and ſleepy, others had need be more diligent in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that their defect might be ſupplied, and their ſinne pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

               <p n="2">2. If we wake in duties and worſhip God no better, and get no more good to our ſouls then they that ſleep, our ſin is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then theirs that ſleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we abuſe and take in vain more means and advantages: they that ſleep in ordinances have no uſe of ordinances, are as without them: they that wake in ordinances, have the uſe of them, and to have the uſe of ordinances and not to make uſe of them is the greater ſinne.

<pb n="487" facs="tcp:40764:255"/> will ſinne more, for the body hath more power to ſinne it ſelf, and to helpe the ſoul to ſinne being awake then aſleep.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Take heed you provoke not God to change your wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes into drouſines, ſo will a great change be made in Gods ſervice, and no leſſe in your ſouls. To this end,</p>

Some ſleep from the beginning of the Ordinance, till praier or Sermon begin, as if they came to the houſe of God, not well awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:40764:261"/> or wanted part of their morning ſleep. Some after ſome time of waking and watching, do fall aſleep, as if the ſervice of God were the onely unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant tireſom work.

From whom God doth expect it, and the rather, becauſe others will ſleep? God ſaith in this caſe to them, as to <hi>Judah</hi> in another caſe: <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend.</hi> So ſaith God to his people, Though others ſleep out Word and praier, yet doe not you ſleep.

Thus, they not onely ſin themſelves, but draw on the ſinnes of others. <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes ſins in Gods worſhip, made the people to ſinne, in abhorring the offerings of the Lord: ſo the ſleeping of profeſſours, doth make others more careleſſe of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, thinking ſleeping to be but a ſmall ſinne, elſe they that profeſſe much, would not uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p n="3">3. The godly have more means to keep them awake then others, they have the grace of God in their heart, aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God, they have in their mindes a more clear and thorow light to diſcern of the excellency and worth of Gods worſhip above other things, they have in their conſciences a more divine and ſtrict obſervation of carriages,

               <p n="3">3. Them that ſuffer others to ſleep by them, and do not wake them, they ſuffer God and his worſhip to be wronged, and might prevent it: Is it not their ſin? Yes doubtleſſe. Why was <hi>Meroz</hi> curſed, yea bitterly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="512" facs="tcp:40764:268"/> not out to help the Lord, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23. And our Saviour is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, that not to be for the Lord, is to be againſt him: <hi>he that is not with me is againſt me,</hi> he that doth not what he can for the Lord and his worſhip, is in that regard againſt the Lord and his worſhip: they that therefore do not waken ſleepers, are not with the Lord therein, but againſt him, for they do not for him what they might. Theſe do not that for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and good of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which God requireth to be done for our Neighbours beaſt, though an enemy: <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4. <hi>If thou meet thine enemies Oxe or Aſſe going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it back to him again:</hi> how much more a friends beaſt? When a man ſleeps in time of the word and
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:40764:268"/> praier, he is gonne aſtray, for he ſhould pray and hear: to wake him, is to bring him into the way: if he were an enemy, we were bound to do it, for God hath more care of men, then of Oxen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10. Much more if he were a friend ſhould we do it: <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.5. <hi>If thou ſee the Aſse of him that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee, lying under his burden, and wouldeſt forbear to help him, thou ſhalt ſurely help with him.</hi> A man was bound to help up his enemies Aſſe lying under a burthen, and in caſe new, and freſh thoughts of hatred came into his minde, and he ſhould ſay in his heart, he is mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I have no good will unto him, I will not do to him that good turne, he was to lay aſide all, and in any caſe to help him to lift it up: And is not a ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:40764:269"/> man in Gods worſhip under his burden, even the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt burden, ſin, which ſinks the ſoul to hell: and doth not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king take off this burden? and doth not ſleeping continue this burden on them? and they that ſuffer them to ſleep, ſuffer them to lie under their burden, which ſhews a want of mercy, which God would not have us to ſhew unto the beaſt that lies under the burden, no not the beaſt of an enemy, much leſſe to the beaſt of a friend, and leaſt of all, to our neighbour himſelf. This fault is the greater, if we ſhall enquire into the ſame, in the cauſes thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It proceeds from want of love. Were there that affection to our neighbours good ſhould be, we would not ſuffer them
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:40764:269"/> to loſe that good they might get, nor to ſin by ſleeping: but as ſin hath made man defective in love to himſelf, therefore he ſleeps in Gods worſhip: ſo much more hath it made him ſcant in love to his neighbour, and therefore he ſuffers him to ſleep: <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him.</hi> Why muſt a man rebuke his neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him? The reaſon is rendred, <hi>thou ſhalt not hate thy brother:</hi> So when we ſuffer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſin, and particularly in ſleeping, and do not labour to help them, it is from want of love. To neglect a duty to our brother is a ſin, but to neglect it for want of love, is a greater ſin: not to awake a ſleeping
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:40764:270"/> brother is a ſin, but not to wake him for want of love to him, is a double ſin: yet thus it is, we do not awake thoſe that ſleep, becauſe we are wanting in love unto them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another cauſe why we doe not wake ſleepers, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, an ungrounded conceit that God hath not committed to us the care of our neighbours, but it is enough if we look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelves: the common proverb, though ungodly, ſhews what is in mens mindes: every man for himſelf, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one look to one. That there is ſuch a conceit in mens mindes, as appears further, by <hi>Cains</hi> anſwer to the Lord, which was no put off for that time, but did ſpring, no doubt, from a principle, ſeated in his underſtanding. The Lords
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:40764:270"/> queſtion did import a care that lay upon <hi>Cain</hi> concerning his brother: <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.9. Where is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> thy brother? <hi>Cains</hi> anſwer doth acknowledge no ſuch duty of care belonging to him; I cannot tell: Am I my brothers keeper? he knew not where he was, nor did he conceive it to be his duty to know what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of him, he did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that the care of his brother did lie upon him; So ſurely men think it is not their duty to take care of their neighbours; contrary to the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſecond table, which are ſummed up in this one word. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> what care we take of our ſelves in the firſt place, we muſt take of our neighbour in a ſecond place. To neglect our duty to our neighbour is a
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:40764:271"/> ſin, but to neglect it upon this ground, becauſe we think it is no duty, is a double ſin, to deny both our duty, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third cauſe why we do not waken ſleepers, is a baſe and unchriſtian fear that we ſhall anger them, they will be diſpleaſed at us: grant it be ſo; Shall we runne upon Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpleaſure to avoid mens? If thou awake thy neighbour, he will be diſpleaſed; and if thou awake him not, God will be diſpleaſed; make thy choice of Gods diſpleaſure or mans, ſhew thy ſelf holy, and not corrupt, let holy fear of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure baniſh corrupt fear of mans diſpleaſure. Wilt thou eſteem thy affliction a greater evil then their ſin, when they ſtand in competition? If thou do awake
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:40764:271"/> them, and they be angry, it is but thy affliction, which is thus ſweetned, that it befalls thee in a way of obedience, thou doſt endure it for doing thy duty: if thou ſuffer them to ſleep, thou ſuffereſt them to ſin, nay thou ſinneſt thy ſelf, in that thou doeſt not thy duty to keep them from ſin. Not to awake them is a ſin, but to forbear upon this ground, leſt we ſhould procure trouble to our ſelves, is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſin, to preferre our comfort before the preventing of their ſin, and our own.</p>
               <p>Many objections come to be anſwered in this caſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſee one ſleep indeed, but I cannot reach him, he is ſo farre from me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If thou cannot reach him thy ſelf, yet ſpeak to ſome body elſe, if thine eie cannot
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:40764:272"/> make uſe of thy hand to wake him, yet let it make uſe of ſome other mans hand, if thou ſtirre up and provoke another to doe it, it is all one as if thou thy ſelf didſt it: beſide, I have ſeen ſome lengthen their arm with a ſtaffe, to call others into their ſeats, and had they as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the ſouls of their neighbours, as to expreſſe cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, they would lengthen their arms with a ſtaffe alſo to waken them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Object.</hi> They who are neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then I will not do it, though I be within reach, and why ſhould I doe it, ſince they that might better will not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The queſtion is not what they who are neerer doe, but whether they do well or ill: if they doe well in not waking them, do thou follow them: if
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:40764:272"/> they doe ill, thy beſt way is not to follow them: <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. God ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this particular needeth urging, and I know not when I ſhall have the like occaſion, therefore I will uſe three ſorts of arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To all in generall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To unregenerate men by themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the people of God by themſelves.</p>
               <p>The arguments that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That proverb of <hi>Solomon chap.</hi> 10.5. <hi>He that ſleepeth in harveſt is a ſonne that cauſeth ſhame.</hi> All men beſtirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in harveſt, and if a man ſleep then, all his friends are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of him, for ſleep now is moſt unſeemly and uncomely, now men have moſt need to
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:40764:276"/> wake and work, there is moſt occaſion, and moſt benefit. And is not every Lords day an harveſt day? a day of ſpirituall plenty? wherein men may ſtore their ſouls? if therefore they ſleepe on that day, Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and people will be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of them: what ſleep when there is moſt work to do, in the buſieſt ſeaſon when moſt good is to be gotten? ſleeping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a ſhamefull ſinne, and if we have any ſhame in us, unleſſe we care not what we do, nor who ſee us in our uncomeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, let us ſhake off ſleeping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a ſorrowfull diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eting ſinne: the end of ſleeping in Gods worſhip will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. There is a three fold time, even in this life, wherein ſuch ſleeping will diſquiet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Time of the want of thoſe
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:40764:277"/> ordinances wherein we have ſlept, when men ſhall wiſh they had but thoſe ſermons and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they have ſlept out, how heavy will it be? when men ſhall think, that had they the ordinances now, they would wake in them, whereas when they enjoyed them, they ſlept, how heavy will it be? when men ſhall think the ordinances are not ſo much gon or taken away by force, but they have ſlept them away, it hath been their voluntary careleſſe doing, had they waked, they ſtill had injoyed them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond time, is the time of their conſcience awaking, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome other occaſion, the more ſinnefull reſt ſoul or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy have had, the more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſquiet, when the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is awaked by divine light
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:40764:277"/> and power, to do it's office: the ſoul may be areſted at Gods ſuit ſpecially for ſome one ſin, but then will God take his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to lay upon the ſoul o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes, for God ſtores up trouble, as men ſtore up ſinne, that it comes by heaps when it comes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Time of the want of ſleep in ſicknes. Then as the bodies of men ſhall toſſe from ſide to ſide, ſo their mindes ſhall roll from thought to thought, from Lords day to Lords day, from Sermon to Sermon, then ſhall the ordinances they have ſlept in, accompany them, wake and watch with them. As they turned their ſeats into beds, their heads were ſo heavy, that they needed no place of eaſe: ſo now their beds ſhall be turned into ſeats, hard under them, that they
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:40764:278"/> ſhall take no reſt. When men ſhall thinke the ſleep they ſhould have now in ſicknes to make the pain leſſe, the nights ſhort, their bodies more able to bear, they have had it long agoe, they ſpent it prodigally, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt now pinch for it: how heavy will it be?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It puts God upon violent courſes, to awaken men and make them lively in his ſervice, when men do not awake of themſelves, the vapours being diſſolved and ſenſes looſned, which is naturall, we do by ſound, or by ſhaking them force them to awake: ſo when the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Gods apointed natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall way, will not awaken them, God forcibly breaks open the eyes and eares of men.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving finiſhed the fift hinderance of our earneſt worſhipping of God, ſleep. I now come to the ſixth and laſt ſlothfullneſſe, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here delivers, as an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to fervency of ſpirit, and therefore an hinderance to it. In this verſe the Apoſtle doth
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:40764:289"/> direct in the manner, and end of all our ſervice to God and man: for the manner, it muſt be with fervency, fervent in ſpirit: for the end, it muſt be to ſerve God, not our ſelves or others, but in the firſt place, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve God, for his uſe and advantage. That they might not be hindred in this fervency, he diſcovers the impediment of it, which he diſwadeth them from, <hi>viz.</hi> ſlothfullnes. Though this verſe may ſeem to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the duties of charity, becauſe they immediately goe before, yet as much may be ſaid for the duties of piety, for they immediately follow after, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>rejoycing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing instant in praier.</hi> Being therefore ſet in the middle between both the duties of piety and charity, it
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:40764:289"/> may moſt fitly be applied to both, nay we ſhall do wrong, if we take it from either. Beſide, the object whereabout fervency is to be exerciſed, and ſloth avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is generall, propounded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint or limitation. Not ſlothfull in buſineſſe; he doth not ſay in love, in giving ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in hoſpitality, in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the neceſſity of the Saints, but in buſineſſe, any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious labour or exerciſe, (as the word ſignifieth) whether it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern God or man. I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to my purpoſe in hand, ſpirituall buſineſſe and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof the Apoſtle treateth in the chapter, as well as of civill and outward offices of love to our neighbour. The Apoſtle exhorteth to fervency of ſpirit in ſuch imployments, and to help that way, dehort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:40764:290"/> from ſlothfullneſſe, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is an oppoſite, and enemy to fervency, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt and ſtand together, ſloth will hinder fervency, and fervency will hinder ſloth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N.</hi> Sloth is an hinderance to fervency in ſpirituall buſineſſe. Not ſlothfull but fervent, take away ſloth, or there will be no fervency: a ſlothfull ſpirit brings forth cold ſervice. What was the reaſon the fervant that had but one tallent, did hide it, and not imploy it, ſome increaſe he might have gotten, though not ſo much as the reſt? Our Saviour renders the reaſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.26. <hi>Thou wicked and ſlothfull ſervant.</hi> He was a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſervant of an ill ſpirit, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to think hardly of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, then to doe his duty: and a ſlothfull ſervant that had no

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the fruit of the fall, which hath brought about a double cauſe of ſloth, one within us, and another without us. The cauſe of ſloth within us is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The loſſe of inward ſtrength, activity and ability unto action, the native and naturall ſtrength of ſoul and body is gone, we are altogether weakneſſe and inſufficiency, and how ſhould a man be willing unto that he is too weak for? Naturally we
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:40764:294"/> know not how to doe things in the beſt way; we know not the benefit of labour; our will is perverſe, refuſing what we ſhould chuſe, and our affections careleſſe, ſo that we cannot ſet about any action without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble and diſquiet, in regard of our unfitneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The contrariety that is in our nature to the law of God: if God would have us love la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, we love ſleep, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.13. and ſo abhorre labour. The outward cauſe of ſloth is the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and toil, which ſin hath made unavoidably to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all actions, as a puniſhment and part of the curſe which God hath threatned, and man deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (wherein he is ſeparated from God, who is in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all of comfort, and works all his works with eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort)
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:40764:294"/> whereas man in innocency ſhould have laboured without trouble: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.15. God ſet <hi>Adam</hi> to dreſſe the garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and to keep it, but ſpeaks of no toil. <hi>Adam</hi> was made perfectly fit for all imployment, and fitneſſe for action cauſeth comfort therein. The bleſſing of God alſo was perfectly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he dwelt in the midſt of bleſſing: and <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.21. <hi>The bleſſing of God maketh rich, and he addeth no ſorrow with it;</hi> Where Gods bleſſing is, there ſorrow cannot be, if it be in perfection and fullneſſe as with <hi>Adam.</hi> But now that ſin hath entred into the world, and the curſe of God by ſin, a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not uſe any power of ſoul, or part of body, without vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and toil: the ſoul is vexed in its labour: Eccleſ. 1.13. <hi>I gave
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:40764:295"/> my heart to ſeek and ſearch out by wiſdom, concerning all things that are done under the heaven: this ſore travell hath God given to the ſonnes of men, to be exerciſed therewith;</hi> Let a man ſet a work his wiſdom, to finde out the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of actions, he ſhall finde that travell ſore and grievous, to exerciſe and humble him therewith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>I gave my heart to know wiſdome, and to know madneſſe and folly: I perceived that this alſo is vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſpirit. For in much wiſdome is much grief: and he that increaſeth knowledge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth ſorrow.</hi> The labours of the ſoul, the exerciſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and knowledge in the means thereof, is accompanied with grief, and ſorrow, and vexation of minde. The body is toiled and wearied in it's la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:40764:295"/> ſweat forced out, and ſtrength weakned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread,</hi> Gen. 5.29. <hi>This ſhall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, becauſe of the ground which the Lord hath curſed.</hi> The curſe of God upon the ground did not bring man labour, but toilſome, painfull afflictive labour. This outward trouble which accompanieth all labour, meeting with an inward love of eaſe and averſnes unto labour, muſt needs further and increaſe the ſame. When a man findes himſelfe unfit for action, and therefore diſquietnes will ariſe from that unfitnes, it will make him backward thereunto; but when he conſidereth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes from within, ſhall be met with outward trouble, that cleaves faſt even by the bond
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:40764:296"/> and tie of Gods truth unto all labour, it will make him more backward.</p>
               <p>Moſt of all are theſe cauſes of ſloth found in ſpirituall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inward and outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe our greateſt weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and inſufficiency lies in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall actions, mans perfection in innocency was to be after Gods Image, ſo that though he could perfectly dreſſe and keep the garden, do the work of his particular calling, rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern all the creatures put under his feet: yet he could beſt do thoſe works that come neareſt to the works of God, ſpirituall and divine actions, love the chief good, and delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in communion with God: on the contrary now he hath loſt the Image of God, he can
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:40764:296"/> do any thing better then ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall actions; naturall and civil actions he can do, but expreſſe no life of grace &amp; holines there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, no more then a dead man can expreſſe naturall life. And when God hath beſtowed grace upon men, yet that is but imperfect, the contrary ſloth doth remain; ſpirituall actions are ſtill above, and moſt contrary to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall temper, ſo that the ſoul quickned by grace is moſt unfit for them, therefore moſt diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et will thence ariſe to their ſouls, which will make them more backward to them then to other actions, any farther then faith aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, doth apply and make uſe of the all-ſufficiency of Chriſt: doth not experience tell us that the vexation which ariſeth from ſenſe of inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:40764:297"/> unto ſpirituall duties, doth keep back and is a continuall clogge unto them in the way to ſuch performances. Beſide our nature is enmity to the law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. therefore moſt enmity to that which is moſt Gods law, as the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the firſt table.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The curſe lies heavier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpirituall actions, the curſe of ſorrow that attends actions, for where the bleſſings of comfort did moſt appear, there the cauſe of ſorrow will be moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, but the bleſſing of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort was eſpecially contained in ſpirituall actions, becauſe a man in them did come neareſt to God, and had moſt to do with him, the fountain of comfort therefore the curſe of ſorrow is moſt found in ſpirituall actions, becauſe in them naturally a man
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:40764:297"/> is furtheſt from God, and doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaſt expreſſe him. And though the godly do finde much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and comfort in holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, more then in other actions, yet they taſt of the curſe here, more then elſewhere, they finde more travill trouble and ſorrow attending ſpirituall actions then any other; the ſweat of their browes and wearines of their bodies is not ſo troubleſome, as the pain of their hearts in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties; their generall calling is more ſorrowfull and bitter then their particular; an harder matter to keep their thoughts cloſe to good duties, then to their particular callings; their mindes are more vexed and their bodies more tired in good performances then with ſo much labour any where elſe. If moſt diſquiet from within and
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:40764:298"/> from without be found in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall actions, then there is moſt cauſe of ſpirituall ſloth.</p>
               <p>This ſpirituall ſloth that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our fervent performance of good duties is improved and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed ſundry wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By ignorance of three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Our neceſſity and want of ſpirituall actions, we ſee not what need we have to pray much, and hear much, becauſe we naturally want Gods favour grace apart in heaven, and they that are renewed have but little grace, much to do with it and much oppoſition againſt it, yet know not what need they have of the increaſe of grace. When our Saviour commandeth his Diſciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.31, 33. to take no thought, <hi>ſaying, what ſhall we eat, or what ſhall we drink?
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:40764:298"/> or where withall ſhall we be clothed, But firſt ſeek the kingdome of God and his righteouſnes:</hi> doth he not give us to underſtand that they, and ſo we, are more ſenſible of wants for our bodies then for our ſoules, that we had need be called from the one unto the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ignorance of the worth and excellency of holy duties, which have a worth above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther actions, inaſmuch as they are commanded in the firſt place, do require more expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of grace, do more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concern God, do bring more honour to him; we do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on Gods day and at other times, becauſe God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, others do ſo, and we are wont ſo to do, but we look at them as mean work, as poor imployment, we do not ſee the
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:40764:299"/> hidden worth and excellency of them; It is not in vain, that the Lord ſaith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. they ſhould call the Sabbath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. It is one thing to keep the Sabbath and another thing to keep it as an high day, a day of honour, thinking our ordinary worldly thoughts, words and works, too mean and baſe for it: we perform good duties, but we know not the honour of them; if we did we ſhould not be aſhamed of good ſpeeches and actions, as if they were matter of ſhame rather then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Ignorance of the benefit and good that redounds unto us by the performance of good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as increaſe of our commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, increaſe of his Image in us, increaſe of peace and comfort, increaſe of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:40764:299"/> good things. Why doth God ſo frequently uſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the benefit, to move us unto performance of them? but to declare our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance herein, as well as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his bounty, and to meet with our ſelf-love and deſire of our own good. If we know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally the trouble and toil of good duties, and not ſo well know our want, the worth and benefit of them, how ſhould we but be backward unto them, as diſquieting us without any great neceſſity, worth or benefit to countervail that diſquiet.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Spirituall ſloth is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and increaſed by falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in our mindes. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Leſſe frequencie in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming good duties and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencie will ſerve the turne, and
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:40764:300"/> if leſſe will do what needs more. Are not the hearts even of the godly apt to ſay, what need we be ſo often in prayer, and take ſo much paines with our hearts therein? ſurely God is not ſo ſtrict, nor the way to heaven ſo ſtreight? Why doth the Apoſtle call for all diligence in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of grace to grace, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. and in making <hi>our calling and election ſure, verſ.</hi> 10. but that we thinke a little will ſerve? Why doth our Saviour call the way to heaven a ſtrait gate, and narrow way, <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="577" facs="tcp:40764:300"/> are not backward to ſay, that they hope to get to heaven with leſſe adoe, and if leſſe will not ſerve, God helpe them; That there is no need of ſo much paines in good duties, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to prove by experience; others (ſay they) have done well, others have done well in times paſt, and do well now, that take not ſo much pains, ſpend not ſo much time in good duties, labour not ſo much with their hearts, were not ſuch and ſuch honeſt men? were they not well thought of, of the Church of God? are they not gon to heaven? dare you think otherwiſe? yet they were not forward, ſtrict, and preciſe as ſome, they went on fairely and made not ſo great a noiſe and ſtirre in religion. Are not ſuch and ſuch now well thought of,
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:40764:301"/> you would be loath to think they do not fear God, that they ſhall not go to heaven, yet they do not ſo much as keep company with the godly, you can diſcern in them no great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains-taking for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, one may therefore do well, and get well to heaven, where nothing will be wanting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much adoe; the labour then is well ſpared, ſo ſaith ſloth, ſpare what one can; but reaſon grounded, upon experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſaith, a man may do well without ſo much labour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpare it. This reaſoning is falſe, for ſuppoſe ſome have gotten to heaven, and ſhall get to heaven, that are not ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in good wayes, and ſo ſhall do well in the end, yet they do not ſo well in the way. Who knows what ſmart their ſloth
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:40764:301"/> coſts them, in life, in time of ſicknes, in the houre of death? who knows what peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, grace, what heaven upon earth they deprive themſelves of? who knows how God in Ordinances would raiſe them up to heaven, and come down from heaven unto them, were they more carefull to take pains? Nor do they ſo well in the end, they ſhall have leſſe grace, and glory in heaven, leſſe of God, and ſo be leſſe happy: They ſhall have a crown, but not be ſet with pearls; they ſhall ſit in thrones, but not ſo near the King of Kings, as others; they ſhall be filled with the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Gods pleaſures, but their veſſells ſhall not be ſo able to contain as others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no profit in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming good duties, we ſhall
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:40764:302"/> fare no otherwiſe, no better, in performing them, then if we neglected them, <hi>Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>What profit ſhould we have, if we pray unto him?</hi> We ſay in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, as good ſit for nought, as work for nought: this keeps men from the work and labour of prayer, a conceit there is no profit in it, they ſee no good come of it; they that pray much and ſpend much time in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes, are as poor in the world, as much deſpiſed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted as any, yea and more, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Ye have ſaid, it is vain to ſerve God and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances, and walked mournfully before the Lord of hoſts?</hi> They are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſay, that it is vain to ſerve God, an unprofitable way, and they undertake to prove it by their own experience, they
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:40764:302"/> have kept Gods Ordinances, and have mourned for their fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, yet have found no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, things have gon no better with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17.18. they ſpeak their mindes fully ſince they left off burning incenſe to the Queen of heaven, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all things, and were conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with famine and ſword, but when they did burn incenſe to the Queen of heaven, they had plenty of victuals, were well and ſaw no evil: ſo the godly have times of temptation, wherein carnall reaſon, aſſiſted by Satan, doth prevail to make them think and ſay, all their ſincerity is in vain, and the pains they have taken in Gods ſervice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13. <hi>Verily, I have clenſed my heart in vain, and waſhed mine hands in innocency,</hi> he thought that neither the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:40764:303"/> of his heart, nor innocency of his converſation was to any purpoſe, he ſhould be never the better for it. Nay, becauſe the more they pray and walk in the uſe of Gods means, ſometimes the worſe matters are with them in providence; are they not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to reaſon from ſenſe, that there is no benefit in preciſenes and ſtrictnes. This is a falſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. There is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and great reward. If ſo ſmall a matter, as a cup of cold water, given for Gods ſake, ſhall not go unrewarded: how much leſſe greater matters? Gods righteouſnes is ingaged, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. He may as ſoon ceaſe to be righteous, as leave unrewarded the labour of his peoples love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So much pains and care about good duties will hinder the particular calling, and ſo the
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:40764:303"/> benefits of this life, and bring poverty. And though the godly do not expreſſely ſay ſo, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, yet would they not take more pains about good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if they did think it would not hinder their particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and profit, which they are ſo ſenſible of. This is a falſe reaſoning, for though carefull and fervent performances of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may take up more time, yet if it bring a double bleſſing what loſſe will there be? That it is thus, we may ſee in the caſe of the <hi>Iewes, Hag.</hi> 1.2. They did not refuſe to build the Temple and therein to take care of the Lords worſhip, but they were careleſſe of it, and for careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he doth reprove them. This people ſay, the time is not yet come, the time that the Lords houſe ſhould be built, at
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:40764:304"/> preſent they wanted opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hoped they ſhould have opportunity afterward, but would not try whether oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity would ſerve. See how this careleſſenes of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice did redound to the fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all their care about their own occaſions, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>ye have ſown much and brought in little,</hi> he that earneth wages, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wages, to put it into a bagge with holes, their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour did not proſper, they were not the richer for their ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and labouring, they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for much and it came to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>I did blow upon it,</hi> I called for a drought, Why? becauſe my houſe is waſt, and ye run every one to your own houſe. Their too much care of their own occaſions and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſenes of Gods ſervice, got
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:40764:304"/> them nothing, but it loſt them much: <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>When one came to a heap of twenty meaſures, there were but ten; when one came to the preſſe fat, to draw out fifty veſſels, there were but twenty.</hi> When come doth not prove doth not fill, men do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that this is, becauſe they take more care about their own matters, then Gods ſervice. It follows, <hi>I ſmote you with blaſting and mildew, and with hail in all the labours of your hands,</hi> when mens corn is ſpoiled with blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and mildew, and hail, they do not conſider it is, becauſe they are careleſſe of Sabbaths, and Ordinances of God, more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of his ſervice, then their own occaſions: on the other ſide, ſee, how care of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice brings a bleſſing upon our occaſions, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18, 19. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:40764:305"/> from this day, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Lords Temple was laid, conſider it, from this day I will bleſſe you. And that they may know that the Lord doth bleſſe them becauſe of their care of his worſhip, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; <hi>Is the ſeed yet in the barn?</hi> Is it already paſt Gods bleſſing? <hi>yea as yet the vine and the fig-tree, and the pomgranet, and the Olive tree hath not brought forth:</hi> Zach. 8.10.11. <hi>before this time there was no hire for man nor any for beaſt,</hi> but now I will not be as in the former dayes, for the ſeed ſhall be proſperous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that what time Gods ſervice takes up from our callings, it will abundantly make up in bleſſing; and it muſt needs be ſo, for all ſucceſſe is Gods, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1. <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it,</hi>
                  <pb n="587" facs="tcp:40764:305"/> and where God is beſt ſerved, he will beſtow the moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The comfort will not countervail the ſorrow, the eaſe, the difficulty, the reſt the labour. Thus much we may gather from the ſluggards ſpeech, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Better is a handfull with quietneſſe, then both the hands full with travell and vexation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> He thinks the filling of both hands will not be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the pains taken therein, the leſſe he hath, the leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and the more, the more diſquiet, and that diſquiet will not be exceeded by comfort and quiet, but the vexation ſeems to him more then the quiet, therefore one handfull is rather to be choſen, then both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the leſſe he hath, the leſſe diſquiet. So much alſo is
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:40764:306"/> implied in the ſpouſe, her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Chriſt, calling on her to awake out of the bed of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ariſe and open to him: <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3. <hi>I have put off my coat, how ſhall I put it on? I have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my feet, how ſhall I defile them?</hi> Had ſhe thought the benefit would have countervailed the trouble, ſhe would not have made that exception. This is a falſe reaſoning, for it ſaith; Chriſt hath not purchaſed ſo much as ſin hath deſerved.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As the difficulty, of good waies is unavoidable, ſo uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable, not poſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, the evil, and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of good waies is deſtroying: Prov. 22.13. <hi>The ſlothfull man ſaith, their is a Lyon without:</hi> the difficulties of his way, are as unable to be overcome as a Lyon, he ſhall be ſlain in the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:40764:306"/> ſtreets, nothing but death and deſtruction lies before him: So, many think that frequency and earneſtnes in good duties; much praying, hearing, reading, is the onely way to bring malan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly diſtractions, and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes upon the ſoul, and diſeaſes upon the body. Whereas it is the way of greateſt promiſe, therefore of greateſt bleſſing and good. The godly often think with <hi>David:</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 27.1. They ſhall one day fall, never hold out, never goe thorow the difficulty of holy waies, nor the danger of them, they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hold up their heads with comfort. <hi>Elijah</hi> deſires he might die, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. he thinks he can never keep his life, and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes both: now <hi>Iezabell</hi> is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, whereas the waies of wiſdom are waies of
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:40764:307"/> pleaſantnes, and all his paths are peace, no waies are peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and pleaſant but the waies of wiſdom, and all her waies are ſo; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.9. All the words of wiſdom are plain to him that underſtandeth, ſo are the waies of wiſdom plain to grace, though obſcure and dark to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature: Prov. 14.6. <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is eaſy to him that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth:</hi> to the ſpirituall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, knowledge is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Spirituall ſloth is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and increaſed by neglect of good duties, or careleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them. Neglect of good duties doth weaken di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, for ſtrength not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed doth decreaſe, and doth increaſe ſloth, becauſe ſtrength of oppoſition is removed, yea ſloth is exerciſed. Careleſſe
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:40764:307"/> performance doth increaſe ſloth, becauſe it is an act of it, and every act doth increaſe the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. Let a man pray or hear careleſſely, and he ſhall be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to doe ſo another time. Let a man ſpend one Sabbath care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, not minding whether he be at any publique exerciſe, and he ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l be fitter to doe ſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and at length he ſhall come to think, that there is no difference between the Lords day, and another day, and no matter how he ſpends it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Spirituall ſloth is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and increaſed, by too much uſe of ſenſible comforts, or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſenſuall uſe of them. When we are much in recreation, given to our appetite, to pleaſe and content our ſelves in ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, it will cheriſh a love of eaſe, and an abhorring of
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:40764:308"/> trouble: <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1. <hi>Woe to them that are at eaſe in Zion;</hi> How doe they further themſelves in eaſe? We finde in the ſequel of the chapter; On the one hand they put farre away the evil day, they will not ſuffer thoughts of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come neer them: on the other hand they eat the calves out of the ſtall, they drink wine in bowls, they invent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtruments of muſick, they chant to the ſound of the violl, they bring neer them all things that might pleaſe and content nature, that it increaſeth the love of that eaſe and delight, and averſeneſſe unto trouble: they are not grieved for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> grief can get no place with them, be there never ſo great need.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we doe not exceed in the meaſure of ſenſible good
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:40764:308"/> things, if we miſſe it in the end of the uſe of them, we deſire ſenſible comforts for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, onely the comfort of them, and not to fit us for Gods ſervice: if eaſe be all our end, love, and deſire of eaſe will be cheriſhed by the uſe of them. Means doe not onely bring unto the end, but increaſe the deſire of the end, by bringing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and the end together: good, the more enjoyed, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, becauſe by enjoyment we have experience of the good of it. If we deſire outward good things for eaſe ſake, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſake, becauſe we would be freed from trouble, then the more we enjoy them, the more we ſhall love eaſe, becauſe we ſhall more free the ſweetneſſe and content of it unto nature, whereas if we did uſe outward
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:40764:309"/> mercies, and ſenſible comforts; that we might be ſitter for Gods ſervice, we ſhould finde our ſelves fitted by the uſe of them for his ſervice, and finde our affection thereto increaſed; Means uſed for a ſanctified end, doe increaſe ability, ſanctified ability to attain that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> How doth ſloth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our earneſt worſhipping of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it ſtands in oppoſition to fervency, and ſo fights againſt it. Sloth ſtands in oppoſition to fervency, becauſe it oppoſeth diligence, without which, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency in Gods worſhip will not be attained. That fervency in Gods worſhip, will not be had without diligence, and painſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, appears by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God: <hi>to ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:40764:309"/> of God, and the righteouſneſse thereof,</hi> Matth. 6.33. <hi>To work out our ſalvation,</hi> Phil. 2.12. <hi>To ſtirre up the gift of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. <hi>To contend for the faith,</hi> Jude 3. Which were in vain, if careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would ſerve the turne. It appears alſo by the different af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedneſſe in Gods worſhip in different Chriſtians, the diligent and careleſſe. May not they that obſerve it, ſee ſome more affected and taken up in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? and they are not the idle, careleſſe Chriſtians, but ſuch as take pains, and make a labour of Gods ſervice. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further by the experience of the moſt diligent Chriſtians, who finde a manifeſt difference in the hearts-warmth, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their hearts in holy duties, when they take pains with them, and when they are careleſſe, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:40764:310"/> they finde moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and life of the ſpirit in worſhip, when they have taken moſt pains, to cleanſe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty the veſſell of their hearts, fit for the breathing of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have laboured moſt to ſtirre up grace in their hearts, fit to meet with Gods Spirit. Though it appear to be a truth, that fervency in Gods worſhip, will not be had without dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, yet let us further ſee it in the cauſes thereof, which are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The weakneſſe of grace conſidered in it ſelf. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace is this; that it is imperfect, we have not that full meaſure of ſtrength, which we ſhould have, and which we had in innocency, we have but a part of it, but a little part as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith: <hi>Iob</hi> 26.14. <hi>Theſe are part of Gods waies, but how little a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:40764:310"/> is heard of him?</hi> So could the godly look into their own hearts, they would admire what little grace they have, and that little they have is above, and contrary to that which is our nature ſince the fall, and is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be made leſſe, to be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. To make weak grace, bring forth ſtrong acts, ſuch as fervent worſhipping of God is, will need pains and labour: things very weak are hardly ſtrengthened. Hence is that exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees:</hi> He compares grace to faint hands and feeble knees, which are not eaſily ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Let a man lift up hands that are weak in the joints, they will preſently fall down again, he muſt make a continuall labour
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:40764:311"/> and work of it: Let a man lift up feeble knees, it will coſt him ſome pains, and they will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſink down again; So if we will fervently worſhip God, we doe not lift up ſtrong hands and knees, but feeble hands and knees which we ſhall finde to be a labour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The direct oppoſition that is found againſt fervent worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, both within us and without us. The oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within us is corruption, a diſpoſition contrary, not one onely diſpoſition of coldneſſe in good duties, but many diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, many ſeeds of ſin, all theſe are one nature, they have had longer time of groath in our hearts then grace, they lie at the very root of grace, as ſuckers at the root of a tree, to ſuck a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the nouriſhment; ſome of
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:40764:311"/> them are ever working, every act doth weaken grace: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. <hi>I finde a law in my mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, warring againſt the law of my minde.</hi> Not onely doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption work in the parts of the body, which the Apoſtle calls the members, but it works in oppoſition to grace, as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary to it, on purpoſe to foil and overthrow it: 1 Pet. 2.11. <hi>Abstain from fleſhly lusts;</hi> Why? <hi>they warre against the ſoul,</hi> they doe not onely work in the ſoul, but warre againſt the ſpiritualnes of the ſoul, to make it wholly ſenſuall and carnall.</p>
               <p>The oppoſition without us is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Satan, who is our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as gracious, becauſe therein we are contrary to him. When we were perfectly fit to worſhip God, and he had leſſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage againſt us, yet he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:40764:312"/> quiet, till he had utterly made us unfit to worſhip God; how much more will he now indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make us unfit, when we are in ſome meaſure fit again, and he hath more advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us? When the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19, 20. had told the <hi>Romans</hi> of the commendation of their obedience every where, and had exhorted them to be wiſe unto that which is good, how ſeaſonably doth he adde? <hi>The God of peace ſhall bruiſe Satan under your feet ſhort;</hi> for they might have objected, what an enemy Satan was to them, how he did blinde and befool them, and oppoſe them in what they ſhould ſhew wiſdom in, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did? Satan is Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, he would have God to have no ſervice at all, much leſſe fervent ſervice: the more
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:40764:312"/> ſervice God hath, the leſſe he hath, and the better ſervice God hath, the worſe he hath, <hi>for no man can ſervice two maſters.</hi> No finite being can beſtow it ſelf wholly two waies at the ſame time. Did not Satan himſelf ſet upon our Saviour, who was perfectly able to worſhip God, with deſire that he would wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and promiſed to give him all the Kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, in way of recompence; which ſhewed his enmity unto Gods worſhip to be ſuch, that he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not what he gave, had he it in his power, ſo he could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God of his ſervice?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our particular callings and the comforts of this life, which are not in themſelves oppoſite to Gods ſervice, for God hath made, and appointed nothing
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:40764:313"/> contrary unto himſelf, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to himſelf, and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance in his ſervice; our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings as God hath commanded them, and the comforts of this life, as they are Gods good creatures and bleſſings, have a fitneſſe in them to help and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us in Gods worſhip, but corruption doth make more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of them then grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of our careleſneſſe in the uſe of them, and want of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the grace of God in the uſe of them, and ſo they rather hinder us, then further us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The common and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſinfulneſſe of the times and places in which we live, this is, as much cold water poured upon the fire of our love, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Becauſe iniquity ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, the love of many ſhall wax cold.</hi> A flood of iniquity, will a
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:40764:313"/> thouſand to one, cool and abate the heart of the warm hearted: for in reſpect of men they have many hinderances, and but few helps. Example hath a great force in us, eſpecially if it be generall, for ſo it is the more example; particular and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar forwardneſſe, and ſtrictneſſe is obſerved, reproved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached; Solitarineſſe in any way is uncomfortable and ſo weakning; two are better then one, and more better then a few.</p>
               <p>This oppoſition within us and without us, is therefore ſtrengthened, becauſe it is not ſcattered and divided, but uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If Satan be divided againſt Satan, his kingdom cannot ſtand, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.26. Satan and corruption doe not work ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ally by themſelves, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:40764:314"/> to Gods ſervice, but joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both together: Satan works in and by corruption: <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22, 23. When <hi>Peter</hi> diſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our Saviour from going up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there to ſuffer, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Maſter pity thy ſelf, theſe things ſhall not be unto thee: our Saviour anſwereth, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me, Satan, for thou ſavoureſt not thoſe things which be of God, but thoſe things which be of men.</hi> He did perceive Satan working in <hi>Peters</hi> carnall diſpoſition, which loves eaſe, but cannot endure trouble: <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31, 32. Satan hath deſired to winnow you as wheat: our Saviour ſaw that Satan would work with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> carnall worldly fear, to make him ſo ſhamefully deny his Lord and Maſter. So Satan doth work with our corruption, in the uſe of our callings, and
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:40764:314"/> outward comforts, to make us ſin in them. Satan doth ſometimes caſt in temptations over, and beſides, and without our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but he doth ordinarily aſſiſt, and work with our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Fervency in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will not be had without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, becauſe to make grace fervent and lively, there muſt be aſſiſtance and influence from heaven; Rom. 8.26. <hi>The ſpirit helpeth our infirmity, for we know not how to pray as we ought:</hi> Jude 20. <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> we cannot pray without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods Spirit: <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake, O North-winde, and come thou South, blow upon my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that the ſpices thereof may flow forth:</hi> our graces though the ſeed of them have taken root in our hearts, yet will not put forth,
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:40764:315"/> without the winde of heaven which bloweth where it liſteth, without the Spirit of God doth breath upon them. The aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the ſpirit will not be had without diligence, theſe two goe together, and depend one upon another, our diligence and Gods aſſiſtance: Phil. 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your ſalvation, for it is God that worketh both the will and the deed;</hi> God will no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe work in us, then as we work with him. The ſlothfull mans talent was hid in a napkin, no uſe made of it. The ſpirit will not breath in us, without our diligence and pains.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſpirit is at pains to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen grace; will he take pains for us, and will he allow us to take no pains for our ſelves? he is at pains in his Ordinances, at pains by affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:40764:315"/> at pains to oppoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, to watch advantages, to help grace. Shall the ſpirit take pains for us, and we be idle?</p>
               <p n="2">2. It agrees and ſuits well to the worth and dignity of the ſpirits aſſiſtance to coſt pains, Shall common matters, and matters of price, be had with one and the ſame labour? doth it not better agree to the worth of things, that different worth ſhould challenge different la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the leſſe worth in things, the leſſe labour about them, the more worth, the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? Thus our Saviour doth expreſſe things, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. ſpeaking of earthly good things, he ſaith, they ſhall be added to us, caſt in as an over-plus, but ſpeaking of heavenly things, he bids us ſeek the kingdom of
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:40764:316"/> God take pains about that, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently imploy our ſelves; we muſt take no pains about earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, in compariſon of the pains we take about ſpirituall things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will help to our prizing of the ſpirits aſſiſtance, and conſequently to our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for it, not to attain it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pains, our knowledge of the worth of heavenly things is but little, it is increaſed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the difficulty in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them; evil things come eaſily, good things hardly: and the more we know the worth of the ſpirits aſſiſtance, the more we ſhall value and prize it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, if the ſpirits aſſiſtance ſhould not be ſo precious in it ſelf, as it is, yet it is of worth to us, if we attain it by diligence, for it coſteth us much, and what
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:40764:316"/> we pay much for, we ſet ſtore by. And according as we prize the ſpirits aſſiſtance, we ſhall be thankfull for it: the greater good it is, the greater mercy from God to us, and the more cauſe of thankſgiving. If thus it be, that fervency in Gods worſhip, will not be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligence, becauſe of the weakneſſe of grace, the ſtrong oppoſition againſt it, and the neceſſity the ſupply of the ſpirit, then ſloth will hinder our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent worſhipping of God, for that is clean contrary to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and doth deſtroy that where it prevails.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sloth hinders our fervent worſhipping of God, as it gives advantage to Satan, the enemy thereof. Satan hath alway a ready minde to hinder us in Gods ſervice, but he hath not
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:40764:317"/> alwaies the ſame advantage, therefore he walks to and fro, ſeeking advantage; Sloth gives him advantage, not onely as it is a corruption, contrary to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent worſhipping of God, and ſuitable to the Devils diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby he worketh, but alſo as it is a fit corruption, whereby to ſcrew into the ſoul the Devils temptations againſt the fervency of Gods worſhip, as the difficulty, uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, needleſneſſe, unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe thereof, all theſe ſloth ſtands ready to entertain, and is increaſed thereby. If leſſe will ſerve, what needs more? If it be ſo hard a thing to ſerve God with earneſtneſſe, if there be no profit nor comfort in it, who would take the pains, though he had a love to pains? Much leſſe where there is no love, as
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:40764:317"/> in ſloth. The diligent man hath much adoe to withſtand theſe temptations, they cauſe often waverings and ſtaggerings in them, and preſent abatements of diligence, they make their hearts cold within them, much more muſt they take hold of the ſlothfull, who are prepared and ready for ſuch temptations. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſloth doth give advantage to Satan, as it doth make no uſe of appointed ſtrength againſt him. Duties of preparation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to more ſolemn worſhip, are means of ſtrength againſt Satan, labouring to hinder our ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Gods worſhip, thereby we ſhake off ſloth, ſtirre up dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, procure the preſence and power of the ſpirit. But ſloth will either neglect duties of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, or careleſly perform them, and ſo the ſoul is ſtripped
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:40764:318"/> of that ſtrength againſt Satan. Watchfulneſſe in duty, is a means of ſtrength againſt Satan, but watchfulneſſe is too painfull for ſloth: reſiſting of ſtirrings of corruption, and temptations of Satan in duties, is a means of ſtrength againſt Satan: Jam. 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the devil and he will flee from you:</hi> He is a moſt impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſcontented creature, and cannot indure to be reſiſted, he will not there abide; but reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Satan is too painfull for ſloth, it will not be done without a deteſtation of his temptations, and an increaſe of attention to Ordinances in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Sloth hinders our fervent worſhipping of God, as it doth grieve the holy ſpirit, and make it withdraw his working and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: it grieves the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="613" facs="tcp:40764:318"/>1. As it is contrary to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is all life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, compared to things moſt ſtirring and active, as the fire, the winde.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To its command, to be fervent in ſpirit, to be zealous, to be diligent, not to be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To its title, when it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſpirit of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. for ſloth is not the condition and way of the promiſe, but dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To its operation and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is to baptize with fire, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.11. The ſpirit doth beſprinkle the ſoul with infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med affections toward God and his ſervice. Sloth being thus contrary to the ſpirit, muſt needs grieve the ſpirit, and the ſpirit grieved, will reſerve its aſſiſtance, without which we
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:40764:319"/> cannot fervently worſhip God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe.</hi> To inform us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God hath but little fervent worſhip. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. All unregenerate men are overwhelmed and drowned in ſloth: there is not ſo much as a ſeed or principle of diligence, till grace come into the foul; all the ſervice therefore of men deſtitute of grace, is cold and heartleſſe, whatſoever it may ſeem, ſuch onely as ſloth will afford, and how full are our Congregations of unregenerate men and women.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are many lazy and ſlothfull Chriſtians, that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed perform duties in publike and private, but they make no labour of them, they take no pains to prepare and fit their hearts, they are not diligent to get the aſſiſtance of the ſpirit,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:40764:319"/> they ſay not with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.24. <hi>I will not offer to the Lord a ſacrifice of that which coſt me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> they do not offer the Lord coſtly ſervices, but cheap, ſuch as coſt them nothing; all their preparation to the duties of the Sabbath, is family duties, and it were well, if they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, ſo much the more carefully. No wonder that they are thus idle in Gods ſervice: grace for want of ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is ſluggiſh, they do not uſe their faith, love, and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all wiſdom in their callings, and how ſhould they be diligent in Gods worſhip. Their diligence is taken up other wayes, in ſome about ſome luſt they ſavour. It was their caſe, <hi>Iames</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Ye fight and warre, yet ye have not, becauſe ye aſke not, ye aſke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, becauſe ye ask amiſſe, that
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:40764:320"/> you may conſume it upon your luſts.</hi> They were ſo buſie about their contentions and wranglings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, that they could not pray at all, or if they did pray, it was for their luſts ſake, to get advantage unto them. Thus a man may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about good duties, and his end not be Gods worſhip, but his own corruptions, that they may not be diſcovered, that the ragings of conſcience may be quieted, that he may the more eaſily compaſſe his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and ſinfull ends. The dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of others is taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t matters of the world, meat, drink, apparell, riches. This was their caſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. they ſeem to take much pains to enjoy Chriſt his miniſtry, and miracles, they compaſſe land and ſea, after they had enjoyed him at land, they
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:40764:320"/> take ſhip, and follow him. But he that knew what was in man, did ſee that their diligence was not pitched upon ſpirituall things, becauſe it was taken up other wayes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26, 27. our Saviour peremptorily ſets it down, as a moſt certain truth, <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, ye ſeek me not becauſe ye ſaw the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but becauſe ye did eat of the loaves and were filled:</hi> their pains was not about their ſouls, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their bellies. And again, <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but for the meat that endureth to everlaſting life;</hi> they did take pains indeed, but not about e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting food, wherein they might have honoured God much, Why ſo? their diligence was imployed about periſhing food. Others their hearts are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver clouded with ignorance, and
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:40764:321"/> unacquaintance with their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eſtate, that they ſee not the neceſſity of diligence in holy duties, ſo that they want a main motive and whetſtone unto pains-taking, knowledge of the neceſſity. Others through care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe, ſo long neglect their hearts that at length ſloth ends in diſcouragement, they think their hearts are paſt pains, all labour will do no good, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.30, 31. <hi>I went by the field of the ſlouthfull, and loe it was grown over with thorns, and nettles cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the face thereof, and the ſtone wall was broken down.</hi> So a ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full neglected heart will be ſo overgrown with luſts, that a man will be hopeleſſe of any good ſpringing there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The beſt of Gods ſervants, and the moſt diligent, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pains do they take with their
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:40764:321"/> hearts unto Gods ſervice? how unſtable and unconſtant are they that way? how ſoon doth diſcouragement take hold of them, when they feel their life and fervency in good duties to come hardly? I appeal to the conſciences of Gods people, when we finde our hearts dead, and unaffected in Gods worſhip, do not our conſciences ſmite us that we have been careleſſe of preparation? Is not God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to drive us unto carefull and conſcionable worſhipping of him by afflictions, we need his direction in doubts, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in ſorrows, his deliverance out of troubles, elſe we would not pray ſo fervently, nor hear the word ſo attentively, do not our conſciences thus witneſſe? all theſe things do evidence that God hath but little fervent worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="620" facs="tcp:40764:322"/>2. Who they are that do God the beſt ſervice, ſpend the Sabbath beſt, and perform du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties beſt, the labouring diligent Chriſtian, they that think it no eaſy matter to ſerve God well. It is an ill thing for a ſoul to be troubled at the aproach of the Sabbath, becauſe of it's own unfitnes, but it is a good ſigne that the ſoul apprehends ſome difficulty in keeping a Sabbath well.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To condemn this ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe in ſpirituall imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this argument is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it puts off God with cold ſervice, which is the greater ſin, if we conſider our ordinary and generall diligence in our own occaſions. To take pains in earthly occaſions, and to be careleſſe in Gods worſhip is a great evill, we ſhall fully ſee
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:40764:322"/> it in three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods worſhip doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern God, our callings do immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves; ſhall we do more for our ſelves then for God? ſet up our ſelves more then him? are we not his and not our own? and therefore bound to reſpect him more then our ſelves? Hear what our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.26. <hi>He that commeth to me, and hateth not father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea and his own life, cannot be my diſciple,</hi> that is, as <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>chap.</hi> 10.37. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth friends or himſelf, more then Chriſt, is not worthy of him, God is better then our ſelves, therefore if we do not love him better then our ſelves, we are not fit to injoy him, but if we take more pains about our callings, then his ſervice, we
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:40764:323"/> love our ſelves more then ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods ſervice doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concern our ſouls, our particular callings do immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concern our bodies; if we take more pains about our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings then about Gods worſhip, we ſhew more care of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies then of our ſoules which is a folly; for our ſouls are the beſt part, our bodies are but duſt, when our ſouls are abſent, the worth of our bodies depends upon the indwelling of our ſoules, and not the worth of our ſouls upon our bodies. We may know where we ought to place our chiefeſt affection, by that of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>fear not them that kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul,</hi> if they can kill but the body, no matter of fear, that muſt dye though they kill it not, if the ſoul be alive the
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:40764:323"/> body is ſafe though dead; The body lies open to the violence of man, the ſoul is out of his reach; the body falls ſhort of the ſoul in excellency and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leſſe affection is due to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods ſervice doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our welfare, not only for the preſent, but alſo, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for eternity to come, our particular callings do concern onely the time preſent? ſhall we take more pains about the time preſent, which may be we know not how ſhort, to be ſure, but a moment, then about eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, this is our Saviours argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is full of weight, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth, but for the meat that endureth to everlasting life.</hi> Ye will take pains and ſpend your labour, but do not miſpend it, do not waſte it,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:40764:324"/> ſpend it not about periſhing food, but about food that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth everlaſtingly, earthly things have a time to be, and a time to periſh; the wealth we have now, ere long we ſhall part with for ever; ſpirituall things have a time to be, and ſhall never ceaſe to be, they therefore are worth your labour. Is not this ſpirituall ſloth to be condemned, conſidering ſuch are more diligent for themſelves, then for God, for their bodies, then for their ſoules, for things periſhing, then for things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall? Will not the conſciences of men condemn them for this ſloth, in ſickneſſe? at the day of judgement? in hell, unto all eternity? doubtleſſe it is ſo groſſe a miſcarriage that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but lie heavy upon men, when they ſhall come to caſt up
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:40764:324"/> their accounts, and ſadly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, when their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhall tell them, that they have riſen early, and gon to bed late, about their own oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, but have been too lazy, to read Gods word or to pray; they have endured hard labour before the Sabbath, and after the Sabbath; but on that day, they have been too ſluggiſh to go to the houſe of God: the day appointed for ſpirituall labour, in Gods worſhip, for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hath been the day of their reſt to recover their ſtrength ſpent in the week, it may be in ſinne, to be ſure in their own occaſions: ſurely this ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the torment of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in hel, when they ſhall think with themſelves; that had they been as painfull for their ſouls, as they were for their bodies, they had eſcaped that place of
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:40764:325"/> torment: Nay had they taken as much pains for their ſouls as for ſinne, had they taken as much pains to go to the houſe of God on the Lords day, as they have done to go to the alehouſe, in the week dayes, had they ſearched Gods book, but as much as they have toſſed the cards and tables, yea it may be on the Lords day, they had been Saints in heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To perſwade the godly to ſhake off this ſloth. If we prize the manner of Gods worſhip, and affect it, we muſt do ſo, if we care not how we pray or hear, if we think any affections are meet for him we may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our ſloth. We finde this commanded, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.5. <hi>Take di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent heed to keep the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Moſes charged you, to love the Lord your God, to ſerve him with all your heart and with all
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:40764:325"/> your ſoul;</hi> take heed and diligent heed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence,</hi> we finde it commended, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.25. <hi>Apollo being fervent in ſpirit, taught di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenly the things of the Lord.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. The Apoſtle makes it part of the commendation of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in all diligence. Of our Saviour the head of the Church, that <hi>he went about doing good, Act.</hi> 10.38. he did not onely do good, but was diligent therein. To diſcourage the more from ſloth, and bring in love with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, conſider how the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the holy Ghoſt doth compare them in <hi>Solomons</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs; all which compariſons we may improve with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, againſt ſpirituall ſloth, and for ſpirituall diligence, ſpirituall ſloth being a greater ſin, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under an heavier curſe, and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:40764:326"/> ſpirituall diligence being a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace, and attended with an happier bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For wealth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>He becometh poor that dealeth with a ſlack hand, but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> It hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eſpecially true in ſpirituall riches, the ſlothfull Chriſtian is poor in grace, the diligent Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is rich, hath ſtore and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of precious grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.8. <hi>He that is ſlothfull in his work, is brother to him that is a great waſter,</hi> if a man have a good ſtock of grace, yet by ſlothfullneſſe he will waſte it, not labouring to increaſe it, he will diminiſh it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.4. <hi>the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ſhall beg in harveſt and have nothing,</hi> they who have nothing of their own, nor no intereſt in them that have ſomething are poor indeed, God will ſhut up the hearts of men towards ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:40764:326"/> Chriſtians, when they come to beg counſell and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when they come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their ſpirituall wants and poverty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For honour, ſee how they are compared, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.24. <hi>The hand of the diligent ſhall bear rule, but the ſlothfull ſhall be under tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;</hi> A diligent Chriſtian ſhall be a King in his own ſoul, and amongſt the people of God, God will ſet him up, give him authority, and rule in their hearts, they that can rule them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are fit to rule others, ſo do the diligent; but the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Chriſtian ſhall be an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his own ſoul, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of God, he ſhall be a ſlave and tributary to his luſts, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.29.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For fruit of pains-taking, ſee how they are compared, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.27. <hi>The ſlothfull man
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:40764:327"/> roſteth not that which he took in hunting, but the ſubſtance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent man is precious.</hi> When a ſlothfull Chriſtian hath taken ſome pains, for want of taking a little more he loſeth that pains, as if an huntſman ſhould take pains to kill an hare, and then through lazines ſhould ſuffer the dogs, or ſome other to run away with it: for inſtance, a man is at pains to come to the houſe of God, to pray, in the word or prayer, his heart is much affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he goes his way and thinks no more of it, that man doth in great meaſure loſe his labour. <hi>but the ſubſtance of a diligent man is precious,</hi> what he getteth by labour he doth not eaſily part with, he makes precious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; that help of heart which a diligent Chriſtian find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the Ordinances of God, he thinks oft of, he improves by
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:40764:327"/> prayer, by praiſe, by treaſuring up the ſame: he can tell you what it coſt him to get down ſuch a corruption, to get to ſuch a frame of heart, to obtain ſuch a mercy, how oft he praid, how long he waited, therefore he maketh a precious account thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, That which is not the leaſt to diſcourage us from ſloth, it is full of pride and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedneſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.16. put the wiſdome of ſeven men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the ſluggard conceits he goes beyond it, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for he neither knows what he hath, nor what he wants, and ignorance is the mother and nurſe of pride, If a man knew the thoughts of ſluggiſh Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, he ſhould finde that they think all is well with them, though a man may be able to convince them by reaſon, that
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:40764:328"/> things cannot be well with them. And the devil will not ſtick to tell them all is well to keep them from taking pains. It is a miſery to have an heart em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty of good, but to think an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty heart full, is a double miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo is it with the ſlothfull Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>To help againſt ſloth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diligence, it will be uſefull firſt, To ponder theſe weighty conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Fervency in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and eaſe cannot poſſibly ſtand together, whilſt ſo great oppoſition remains both within us, and without us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The difficulty and toil found in Gods ſervice, is a bitter afflictive fruit of ſin. Shall we not bear the burden we have brought upon our ſelves wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, though not cheerfully? It is a ſigne ſinne is pardoned,
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:40764:328"/> when we have patience to bear the chaſtiſement of ſinne; it is a great favour when there is a will to bear, where there is no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſhake off.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The deceitfull eaſe that proceeds from ſloth, is both Gods loſſe, and thine, and who would covet that eaſe whereby God, and himſelf, his beſt friends muſt loſe?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The more painfull the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God is, the more ſweet, for that ſweetnes comes out of the ſtrong, it is the delightfull fruit of a powerfull conqueſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corruption, of more honour done to God, of the condition of the promiſe performed with a greater meaſure of heavenly aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If ſloth prevail in thy ſoul, it will ſhut out diligence, but at the ſame time it ſhuts in more diſquiet then eaſe, for ſin is ſhut
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:40764:329"/> up in that eaſe; the diſquiet of lawfull labour is but affliction; the eaſe of ſloth is ſin, and ſin is attended with more trouble then eaſe, it will prove more eaſy to taſte the ſower of affliction, then the ſweet of ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be uſefull to inure our ſelves to the ſerious and thorough examination of our hearts, and waies, of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eſtate, this will diſcover what need we have of diligence, and what hurt ſloth hath done us. This cured <hi>Davids</hi> lazines, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.59, 60. Though he were ſlow-paced in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the neglect of this, yet when he was once paſt this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult uſefull duty, he made haſte, he loſt no time, nor ground as formerly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It will be uſefull, not to cheriſh our pride, by poring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what we have atained, but to
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:40764:329"/> ſtrengthen humility, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and ſerious meditation of what we want, and what is to be attained. This helped <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3.13, 14. what he was come to was behind him, he could not ſo redily, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly look upon that, but what he was to come to, was before him in his eye, to alure and draw him forward. Looke we alſo upon what is before us. Haſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome meaſure of ferven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? ſtay not gazing upon that, but look right forth, look on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; doſt ſee what thou wantſt? Look not ſo much upon thy work, as thy patter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not onely of the beſt of creatures upon earth, but alſo and chiefly in heaven, the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect, yea the flaming Angels, yea the Lord Jeſus Chriſt who had zeal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry him through the
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:40764:330"/> flames of hell, to do his fathers will, in whoſe breſt alone that fire of heavenly love dwels, that hath inflamed Saints on earth, and Saints in heaven, which we ſhall finde inflaming us more and more, as we draw near to look upon him as our pattern, with deſire of imitation. The cloſe of all, containing an help in all that hath gon before, (as prayer comes after the ſeverall pieces of the ſpirituall armour: to help our skill in all, and the uſefulnes of all, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6.18.) may fitly be <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, when the people were warm hearted, in their offering to the building of the Temple for the publike ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip of God, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>O Lord God of Abraham, Iſaac, and of Iſrael our fathers, keep this for ever in the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee.</hi>
